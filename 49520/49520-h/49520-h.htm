<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>UNCLE CORNY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> name is Christopher Orchardson, of Sunbury in Middlesex;
and I have passed through a bitter trouble, which I will try
to describe somehow, both for my wife’s sake and my own, as
well as to set us straight again in the opinion of our neighbours,
which I have always valued highly, though sometimes unable
to show it. It has not been in my power always to do the
thing that was wisest, and whenever this is brought up against
me, I can make no answer, only to beg those who love blame
to look at themselves, which will make their eyes grow kinder,
before they begin to be turned on me.</p>

<p>For five and twenty years of life I went on very happily,
being of an unambitious sort, and knowing neither plague nor
pain, through the strength of my constitution and the easiness
of my nature. Most of my neighbours seemed to live in perpetual
lack of something, and if ever they got it they soon contrived
to find something more to hanker for. There were times
when I felt that I must be a fool, or to say the least a dullard,
for slackness of perception, which kept me satisfied with the
life I had to live. But two things may be pleaded well in my
excuse on this account; in the first place, all my time was
spent among creatures of no ambition—trees, and flowers, and
horses, and the like, that have no worry; and what was even
to the purpose more, I had no money to enlarge its love.</p>

<p>For my Uncle Cornelius—better known to all who had
dealings with him as “Corny, the topper”—took care of me,
and his main care was to make me useful, as an orphan should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
be. My father had been his elder brother, and had married
rashly a lady of birth and education far above his own, but
gifted with little else to help her, unless it were sweetness of
disposition, and warmth of heart, and loveliness. These in a
world like ours are not of much account for wearing; and she
had no chance to wear them out, being taken away quite
suddenly. My life was given at the cost of hers, and my
father, after lingering for a few months, took his departure to
look for her.</p>

<p>Old people said that my Uncle Corny had been very fond
of my mother, looking up to her in his youthful days, as a
wonder of grace and goodness. And even now when he spoke
about her, as I have known him to do after a tumbler of grog,
his hard grey eyes would glisten softly, like the vinery glass of
an afternoon, when a spring cloud passes over it. But none
the more for that did he ever plant a shilling in my youthful
hand. This proves his due estimate of money as a disadvantage
to the young.</p>

<p>My uncle possessed an ancient garden, which had once
belonged to a monastery; and the times being better than now
they are, he was enabled to work it so that he made fair living
out of it. We lived in an ancient cottage in the fine old village
of Sunbury, or rather to the westward of that village, and
higher up the river. Our window looked upon the Thames,
with nothing more than the Shepperton Road, and the slope of
the bank to look over. What with water-works, grand villas,
the railway, and other changes, the place is now so different
that a native may scarcely know it. But all was thoroughly
simple, quiet, and even dull to lazy folk, in the days of which
I am speaking.</p>

<p>My parents had managed to leave me so, or had it so
managed by a higher power, that from my very infancy I was
thrown upon Uncle Corny. He was a masterful man indeed,
being of a resolute disposition, strong body, and stout sentiments.
There was no mistaking his meaning when he spoke,
and he spoke no more than a man is bound to do, for his own
uses. Those who did not understand his nature said a great
deal against him, and he let them say it to the width of their
mouths. For he felt that he was good inside, and would be
none the better for their meddling.</p>

<p>He was now about threescore years of age, and wished himself
no younger, having seen enough of the world to know
that to pass through it once is quite enough. Few things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
vexed him much, except to find his things sold below their
value; and that far less for the love of money than from the
sense of justice. But when he was wronged—as all producers,
being one to a thousand, must be—he was not the man to
make a to-do, and write to the papers about it. All he did
was to drive his stick into the floor, and look up at the ceiling.
For his own part he was quite ready to be proved in the wrong,
whenever he could see it; and whatever may be said, I can
answer for it, there are more men now than can be counted in
a year, who are under Uncle Corny’s mark; while an hour would
be ample for the names of those who would dare to look over
my uncle’s head, when he comes to be judged finally.</p>

<p>All this is too much of a preface for him. His manner was
always to speak for himself, and he must become somebody
else, ere ever he would let his young nephew do it for him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>MY KITTY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> shape of a tree is not decided by the pruner only. When
the leader is stopped, with an eye towards the wind, and the
branches clipped to a nicety of experience and of forethought,
and the happy owner has said to it—“Now I defy you to go
amiss this season”—before he is up in the morning perhaps,
his lecture is flown, and his labour lost.</p>

<p>My wise Uncle Corny had said to me, more times than I
can remember—“Kit, you are a good boy, a very good boy, and
likely to be useful in my business by-and-by. But of one
thing beware—never say a word to women. They never know
what they want themselves; and they like to bring a man into
the same condition. What wonderful things I have seen
among the women! And the only way out of it is never to
get into it.”</p>

<p>In answer to this I never said a word, being unable to
contradict, though doubtful how far he was right. But it
made me more shy than I was already, while at the same time
it seemed to fill me with interest in the matter. But the only
woman I had much to do with went a long way to confirm my
Uncle’s words. This was no other than Tabitha Tapscott, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
widow from the West of England, who did all our cleaning and
cooking for us, coming into the house at six o’clock in the
summer, and seven in the winter time. A strange little
creature she appeared to me, so different from us in all her ways,
making mountains of things that we never noticed, and not at
all given to silence.</p>

<p>Once or twice my Uncle Corny, after a glass of hot rum
and water (which he usually had on a Saturday night, to restore
him after paying wages) had spoken, in a strange mysterious
style, of having “had his time,” or as he sometimes put it—“paid
his footing.” It was not easy to make out his drift, or
the hint at the bottom of it; and if any one tried to follow
him home, sometimes he would fly off into rudeness, or if in a
better vein, convey that he held his tongue for the good of
younger people. Such words used to stir me sadly, because I
could get no more of them.</p>

<p>However, I began to feel more and more, as youth perhaps
is sure to do when it listens to dark experience, as if I should
like almost to go through some of it on my own behalf. Not
expecting at all to leave it as a lesson for those who come after
me, but simply desiring to enter into some knowledge of the
thing forbidden. For I knew not as yet that there is no
pleasure rich enough to satisfy the interest of pain.</p>

<p>It was on the first Sunday of September in the year 1860,
that I first left all my peaceful ways, and fell into joy and
misery. And strangely enough, as some may think, it was in
the quiet evening service that the sudden change befell me.
That summer had been the wettest ever known, or at any rate
for four and forty years; as the old men said, who recalled
the time when the loaves served out to their fathers and mothers
stuck fast, like clay, upon the churchyard wall. Now the
river was up to the mark of the road, and the meadows on the
other side were lakes, and even a young man was well pleased
to feel a flint under his foot as he walked. For the road was
washed with torrents, and all the hedges reeking, and the
solid trunks of ancient elms seemed to be channelled with perpetual
drip.</p>

<p>But the sun began to shine out of the clouds, at his very
last opportunity; and weak and watery though he looked, with
a bank of haze beneath him, a soft relief of hope and comfort
filled the flooded valley. And into our old western porch a
pleasant light came quivering, and showed us who our neighbours
were, and made us smile at one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>As it happened now, my mind was full of a certain bed of
onions, which had grown so rank and sappy, that we had not
dared to harvest them. And instead of right thoughts upon
entering church, I was saying to myself—“We shall have a
dry week, I do believe. I will pull them to-morrow, and
chance it.” This will show that what now befell me came
without any fault of mine.</p>

<p>For just as the last bell struck its stroke, and the ringer
swang down on the heel of it, and the murmur went floating
among the trees, I drew back a little to let the women pass,
having sense of their feeling about their dresses, which is to
be respected by every man. And in those days they wore
lovely flounces, like a bee-hive trimmed with Venetian blinds.
They had learned a fine manner of twitching up these, whenever
they came to steps and stairs; and while they were at it,
they always looked round, to make sure of no disarrangement.
My respect for them made me gaze over their heads, as if without
knowledge of their being there at all. Yet they whispered
freely to one another, desiring to know if their ribands were
right for the worship of the Almighty.</p>

<p>Now as I gazed in a general style, being timid about looking
especially, there came into my eyes, without any sense of
moment, but stealing unawares as in a vision, the fairest and
purest and sweetest picture that ever went yet from the eyes to
the heart. To those who have never known the like, it is
hopeless to try to explain it; and even to myself I cannot
render, by word or by thought, a mere jot of it. And many
would say, that to let things so happen, the wits for the time
must be out of their duty.</p>

<p>It may have been only a glance, or a turn of the head, or
the toss of a love-lock—whatever it was, for me the world was
a different place thereafter. It was a lovely and gentle face,
making light in the gloom of the tower arch, and touched with
no thought of its own appearance, as other pretty faces were.
I had never dreamed that any maiden could have said so
much to me, as now came to me without a word.</p>

<p>Wondering only about her, and feeling abashed at my own
footsteps, I followed softly up the church, and scarcely knew
the button of our own pew door. For Uncle Corny owned a
pew, and insisted upon having it, and would allow no one to
sit there, without his own grace and written order. He never
found it needful to go to church on his own account, being a
most upright man; but if ever he heard of any other Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
being shown into his pew, he put on his best clothes the next
Sunday morning, and repaired to the sacred building, with a
black-thorn staff which had a knob of obsidian. Such a thing
would now be considered out of date; but the church was the
church, in those more established times. Here I sat down in
my usual manner, to the best of my power, because I knew how
my neighbours would be watching me; and saying my prayers
into the bottom of my hat, I resolved to remember where I was,
and nothing else. But this was much easier said than done;
for the first face I met, upon looking round, was that of Sam
Henderson the racer, the owner of the paddocks at Halliford,
a young man who thought a great deal of himself, and tried to
bring others to a like opinion. He was not altogether a favourite
of mine, although I knew nothing against him; for he
loved showy colours, and indulged in large fancies that all
the young women were in love with him. Now he gave me a
nod, although the clergyman was speaking, and following the
turn of his eyes I was vexed yet more with his behaviour. He
was gazing, as though with a lofty approval, and no sort of fear
in his bright black eyes, at the face which had made me feel
just now so lowly and so worthless.</p>

<p>In the Manor pew, which had been empty nearly all the
summer—for the weather had driven our ladies abroad—there
she sat, and it made me feel as if hope was almost gone from
me. For I could not help knowing that Mrs. Sheppard, who
arranged all the worshippers according to their rank, would
never have shown the young lady in there, unless she had been
of high standing. And almost before I was out of that thought
my wits being quicker than usual, it became quite clear to
me, who she was—or at any rate who was with her. From
the corner of the pew there came and stood before her, as if to
take general attention off, a highly esteemed and very well
dressed lady, Mrs. Jenny Marker. This was the “lady housekeeper,”
as everybody was bound to call her who hoped to get
orders, at Coldpepper Hall, herself a very well bred and most
kind-hearted woman, to all who considered her dignity. Having
always done this, I felt sure of her good word, and hoping
much too hastily that the young lady was her niece, I made it
feel perhaps less presumptuous on my part, to try to steal a
glance at her, whenever luck afforded.</p>

<p>Herein I found tumultuous bliss, until my heart fell heavily.
I was heeding very scantily the reading of the minister, and
voices of the clerk and faithful of the congregation, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
suddenly there came the words,—“the dignity of Princes.”
And then I knew, without thinking twice, that this young
lady could never have won the dignity of the Manor-pew,
unless she had been a great deal more than the niece of Jenny
Marker. In a moment, too, my senses came to back up this
perception, and I began to revile myself for thinking such a
thought of her. Not that Mrs. Marker was of any low condition,
for she wore two rings and a gold watch-chain, and was
highly respected by every one; but she cheapened all the
goods she bought, even down to an old red herring, and she
had been known to make people take garden-stuff in exchange
for goods, or else forego her custom. The memory of these
things grieved me with my own imagination.</p>

<p>I was very loth to go—as you will see was natural—without
so much as one good look at the sweet face which had blessed
me; but everything seemed to turn against me, and the light
grew worse and worse. Moreover Sam Henderson stared so
boldly, having none of my diffidence, that Mrs. Marker came
forward sharply, and jerked the rings of the red baize curtain,
so that he could see only that. At this he turned red, and
pulled up his collar, and I felt within myself a glow of good-will
for the punching of his head. And perhaps he had
grounds for some warm feeling toward me, for the reason that
I being more to the left could still get a glimpse round
the corner of the curtain, which acted as a total drop of scenery
for him.</p>

<p>When the sermon was finished in its natural course, the
sky was getting very dark outside, and the young men and
women were on best behaviour to take no advantage of the
gloom in going out. For as yet we had no great gas-works,
such as impair in the present generation the romance and
enlargement of an evening service. So that when we came
forth, we were in a frame of mind for thinking the best of one
another.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE TIMBER BRIDGE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">By</span> this time it had become clear to me, that whatever my
thoughts were and my longings—such as those who are free
from them call romantic—there was nothing proper for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
do, except to turn in at our own little gate, and be satisfied
with my own duty inside. And this I was truly at the point
of doing, although with very little satisfaction, when the
glancing of the twilight down the road convinced me of a
different duty. To the westward there happened just here to
be a long stretch of lane without much turn in it, only guided
and overhung partly with trees, and tufts of wild hops which
were barren this year. And throughout this long course, which
was wavering with gloom, a watery gleam from the west set in,
partly perhaps from the flooded river, and partly from the last
glance of sunset.</p>

<p>My hand was just laid upon our wicket-latch, and my
mind made up for no thinking, when the figure of some one in
the distance, like a call-back signal, stopped me. I had not
returned, you must understand, by the shortest possible way
from church, which would have taken me to Uncle Corny’s
door opposite the river; but being a little disturbed, perhaps,
and desiring to walk it off quietly, had turned up to the right
towards the Halliford lane, to escape any gossip, and come back
through our garden. And where I stood now, there was a view
by daylight of nearly half a mile of lane, and the timber bridge
across the brook.</p>

<p>The lane was not quite straight, but still it bent in such an
obliging manner, first to the left and then back to the right,
that anything happening upon its course would be likely to come
into view from our gate. And I saw as plainly as could be,
although beyond shouting distance, a man with his arms spread
forth, as if to stop or catch anybody going further, and nearer
to me the forms of women desirous to go on, but frightened.
It is not true that I stopped to think for one moment who
those women were; but feeling that they must be in the right,
and the man in the wrong as usual, without two endeavours I
was running at full speed—and in those days that was something—merely
to help the right, and stop the wrong. And in less
time than it takes to tell it, I was one of the party. Then I
saw that the ladies were Mrs. Marker, and the lovely young
maiden, who had been with her in church.</p>

<p>“Oh, Master Orchardson, you will take our part,” Mrs.
Marker cried, as she ran up to me; “you will take our part,
as every good man must. That bad man says that we shall
not cross the bridge, without—without—oh, it is too dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Without paying toll to me—this is kissing-bridge, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
wood is now kissing the water. ’Tis a dangerous job to take
ladies across. Kit, you are come just in time to help. Let us
have toll at the outset, and double toll upon landing, my boy.
You take my lady Marker, Kit, because she is getting heavy;
and I will take Miss Fairthorn.”</p>

<p>Sam Henderson spoke these words as if we had nothing to
do but obey him. Perhaps as a man who was instructing
horses, he had imbibed too much of the upper part. At any
rate, I did not find it my duty to fall beneath his ordering.
And as if to make me stand to my own thoughts, the sweetest
and most pitiful glance that had ever come to meet me, came
straight to my heart from a shadowy nook, where the beautiful
maid was shrinking.</p>

<p>“Sam Henderson, none of this rubbish!” I shouted, for
the roar of the water would have drowned soft words. “It is a
coward’s job to frighten women. A man should see first what
the danger is.”</p>

<p>Before he could come up to strike me, as his first intention
seemed to be, I ran across the timbers, which were bowing and
trembling with the strain upon the upright posts, as well as
the wash upon their nether sides. And I saw that the risk
was increasing with each moment, for the dam at the bottom
of Tim Osborne’s meadow, not more than a gunshot above us,
was beginning to yield, and the flood checked by it was
trembling like a trodden hay-rick. Upon this I ran back, and
said, “Now, ladies, if cross you must, you must do it at once.”</p>

<p>“Kit, you are a fool. There is no danger,” Sam Henderson
shouted wrathfully. “Who is the coward that frightens ladies
now? But if you must poke in your oar without leave, you
go first with Mother Marker, and I will come after you, with
the young lady.”</p>

<p>The maiden shrank back from his hand, and I saw that good
Mrs. Marker was pained by his words. “Mother Marker will
go first,” she said, “but with no thanks to you, Mr. Henderson.”</p>

<p>Her spirit was up, but her hands were trembling, as I took
her Prayer-book from them.</p>

<p>“I may be a fool, but I am not a cub,” I answered with a
gaze that made Henderson scowl; “I would rather frighten
ladies than insult them. Now, Mrs. Marker, give me one of
your nice little hands, and have no fear.”</p>

<p>The house-keeping lady put forth one hand, with a tender
look at it, because it had been praised, and then she put forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
one brave foot, and I was only afraid of her going too fast.
The water splashed up between the three-inch planks, for the
lady was of some substance; but she landed very well, and
back I ran to see about her young companion.</p>

<p>“I will not go with you sir; I will go alone. You do not
behave like a gentleman,” she was crying in great distress, as I
came up, and Sam Henderson had hold of both her hands.
This enraged me so that I forgot good manners, for I should
not have done what I did before a lady. I struck Sam heavily
between the eyes, and if I had not caught him by the collar,
nothing could have saved him from falling through the bush,
into the deep eddy under the planks. As soon as I had done
it, I was angry with myself, for Sam was not a bad fellow at
all, when in his best condition. But now there was no time to
dwell upon that, for the flood was arising and rolling in loops,
like the back of a cat who has descried a dog.</p>

<p>“Now or never, Miss,” I cried; “the dam has given; in
a minute, this bridge will be swept clean away.”</p>

<p>She showed such bright sense as I never saw before, and
never can hope to see in anybody else, however they may laugh
through want of it. Without a word, or even a glance at me,
she railed up her dress into a wondrous little circle, and gave
me a hand which I had not the strength to think of, for fear
of forgetting all the world outside. Taking it gently in my
coarse hard palm, I said, “Come,” and she came like an angel.</p>

<p>As I led her across, all my gaze was upon her; and this was
a good thing for both of us. For a scream from Mrs. Marker
and a dreadful shout from Sam—who came staggering up to the
brink and caught the handrail, just as we were shaking upon
the middle dip—these, and a great roar coming down the
meadows, would probably have taken all my wits away, if they
had been within me, as at ordinary times. But heeding only
that which I was holding, I went in a leisurely and steady
manner which often makes the best of danger, and set the
maiden safe upon the high stone at the end, and turned round
to see what was coming.</p>

<p>Before I had time to do this, it was upon me, whirling me
back with a blow of heavy timber, and washing me with all my
best clothes on into the hedge behind the lane. Then a rush
of brown water, like a drove of wild cattle leaping on one
another’s backs, went by, and the bridge was gone with it, like
a straw hat in the wind. But the stone upon which the young
lady stood was unmoved although surrounded, and I made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
signs to her—for to speak was useless—to lay hold of a branch
which hung over her head. As she did so, she smiled at me,
even in that terror; and I felt that I would go through a
thousandfold the peril for the chance of being so rewarded.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as suddenly as it had mounted, the bulk of the
roaring flood fell again, and the wreck of the handrail and some
lighter spars of the bridge hung dangling by their chains.
And soon as the peril was passed, it was hard to believe that
there had been much of it. But any one listening to Mrs.
Marker, as she came down the hill when it was over, must have
believed that I had done something very gallant and almost
heroic. But I had done nothing more than I have told; and
it is not very likely that I would make too little of it.</p>

<p>“Brave young man!” cried Mrs. Marker, panting, and
ready to embrace me, if I had only been dry; “you have saved
our lives, and I would say it, if it were my last moment. Miss
Kitty, I never saw such valour. Did you ever, in all your
life, dear?”</p>

<p>“Never, dear, never! Though I had not the least idea
what this gentleman was doing, till he had done it. Oh, he
must be sadly knocked about. Let me come down, and help him.”</p>

<p>“He put you up there, and he shall fetch you down.
Nobody else has the right to do it. Mr. Orchardson, don’t be
afraid; assist her.”</p>

<p>Now this shows how women have their wits about them,
even at moments most critical. The housekeeper had fled with
no small alacrity, when the flood came roaring; and now with
equal promptitude she had returned, and discovered how best
to reward me.</p>

<p>“I think you might give me a hand,” said the young lady,
still mounted on the high stone with our parish-mark, upon
which by some instinct I had placed her.</p>

<p>“I cannot; I am trembling like an aspen-leaf,” Mrs.
Marker replied, though she looked firm enough; “but our
gallant preserver is as strong as he is brave. Don’t be afraid
of his touching you, because he is a little damp, Miss Kitty.”</p>

<p>This was truly clever of her, and it stopped all reasoning.
With a glance of reproach, the maiden gathered her loosened
cloak more tightly, and then gave me both her hands and
sprang; and I managed it so that she slid down into my arms.
This was not what she intended, but there was no help for it,
the ground being very slippery after such a flood. She seemed
lighter than a feather, and more buoyant than a cork; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
some of that conclusion perhaps was due to my impressions.
Be that either way, I could never have believed that anything
so lovely would be ever in my hold; and the power of it drove
away my presence of mind so badly, that I was very near forgetting
the proper time for letting go.</p>

<p>And this was no wonder, when I come to think about it;
the only wonder was that I could show such self-command.
For the breath of her lips was almost on mine, and her blushes
so near that I seemed to feel their glow, and the deep rich blue
of her eyes so close that they were like an opening into heaven.
My entire gift of words was gone, and I knew not what I did
or thought.</p>

<p>But suddenly a shout—or a speech if one could take it so—of
vulgar insolence and jealousy most contemptible, broke on
my lofty condition. Sam Henderson had been left in black
dudgeon on the other side of the water, and the bridge being
swept away, he could not get at us. We had forgotten all
about him; however, he had managed to run away, when the
great billow came from the bursting of the sluice; and now he
showed his manners and his thankfulness to God, by coming
to the bank and shouting, while he grinned, and clapped his
hands in mockery,—</p>

<p>“Kit and Kitty! Kit and Kitty! That’s what I call
coming it strong; and upon a Sunday evening! Mother
Marker, do you mean to put up with that? See if I don’t tell
your Missus. Kit and Kitty! O Lord, oh Lord! ’Tis as
good as a play, and we don’t get much of that sort of fun in
Sunbury. Holloa! What the deuce—”</p>

<p>His speech was ended, for I had caught up a big dollop of
clod from the relics of the flood, and delivered it into his
throat so truly that his red satin fall and mock-diamond pin—which
were tenfold more sacred to him than the Sabbath—were
mashed up into one big lump of mud, together with the
beard he cherished. Labouring to utter some foul words, he
shook his fist at me and departed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>PEACHES, AND PEACHING</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> seem to be many ways of taking the very simplest fact
we meet and if any man was sure to take things by his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
light, it was my good Uncle. When a friend, or even a useful
neighbour, offered a free opinion, my Uncle Cornelius would
look at him, say never a word, but be almost certain to go downright
against that particular view. One of his favourite sayings
was, “Every man has a right to his own opinion,” although he
was a strict Conservative—and of that right he was so jealous,
that he hated to have his opinions shared. And this was a
very lucky thing for me, as I cannot help seeing and saying.</p>

<p>For the very next morning, a neighbour came in (when I
was gone prowling, I need not say where), and having some
business, he told Tabby Tapscott to show him where her master
was most likely to be found. This gentleman was Mr. Rasp,
the baker, who kept two women, a man, and a boy, and did the
finest trade in Sunbury. And what he wanted now was to
accept my Uncle’s offer, at which he had hum’d and hawed a
week ago, of ten sacks of chat potatoes at fifteen pence a bushel,
for the purpose of mixing with his best white bread. By the
post of that morning Mr. Rasp had heard from the great flour-mills
at Uxbridge, that good grindings were gone up six
shillings a quarter, and sure to be quoted still higher next
week, by reason of the cold, wet harvest. But he did not intend
to tell Uncle Corny this.</p>

<p>That excellent gardener was under his big wall, which had
formed part of the monastic enclosure, and was therefore the
best piece of brickwork in the parish, as well as a warm home
and sure fortress to the peach and nectarine. This wall had its
aspect about S.S.E., the best that can be for fruit-trees, and
was flanked with return walls at either end; and the sunshine,
whenever there seemed to be any, was dwelling and blushing
in this kind embrace. The summers might be bitter—as they
generally are—but if ever a peach donned crimson velvet in
the South of England out of doors, it was sure to be sitting
upon this old red wall and looking out for Uncle Corny.</p>

<p>Mr. Cornelius Orchardson, as most people called him when
they tried to get his money, glanced over his shoulder when he
heard the baker coming, and then began to drive a nail with
more than usual care. Not that he ever drove any nail rashly,
such an act was forbidden by his constitution; but that he now
was in his deepest calm, as every man ought to be in the neighbourhood
of a bargain. His manner was always collected and
dry, and his words quite as few as were needful; and he never
showed any desire to get the better of any one, only a sense of
contentment, whenever he was not robbed. This is often the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
case with broad-shouldered people, if they only move quietly and
are not flurried; and my good Uncle Corny possessed in his way
every one of these elements of honesty.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Orchardson!” said Rasp the baker.
“What a pleasure it is to see a glimpse of sun at last! And
what a fine colour these red bricks do give you!”</p>

<p>“As good as the bakehouse,” said my Uncle shortly.
“But look out where you are treading, Rasp. I want every
one of them strawberry-runners. What brings you here? I
am rather busy now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I happened to see as your door was open, so I
thought I’d just jog your memory, to have them potatoes put
up in the dry, while I’ve got my copper lighted.”</p>

<p>“Potatoes! Why, you would not have them, Rasp. You
said fifteen pence a bushel was a deal too much, and potatoes
were all water such a year as this. And now I’ve got a better
customer.”</p>

<p>“Well, it don’t matter much either way,” said the baker;
“but I always took you, Mr. Orchardson, to be a man of your
word, sir—a man of your word.”</p>

<p>“So I am. But I know what my words are; and we came
to no agreement. Your very last words were—‘A shilling,
and no more.’ Can you deny that, Rasp?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t put it down, sir, and my memory plays
tricks. But I told my wife that it was all settled; and she
said, ‘Oh, I do like to deal with Mr. Orchardson, he gives such
good measure.’ So I brought round the money in this little
bag, thirty-seven shillings and sixpence. Never mind for a
receipt, sir; everybody knows what you are.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so they do,” answered Uncle Corny; “they’d
rather believe me than you, Master baker. Now how much is
flour gone up this morning, and floury potatoes to follow
it? Never a chat goes out of my gate, under one and sixpence
a bushel.”</p>

<p>“This sort of thing is too much for me. There is something
altogether wrong with the times. There is no living to
be made out of them.” Mr. Rasp shook his head at the peaches
on the wall, as if they were dainties he must not dare to look
at.</p>

<p>“Rasp, you shall have a peach,” declared my Uncle Corny,
for he was a man who had come to a good deal of wisdom;
“you shall have the best peach on the whole of this wall, and
that means about the best in England. I will not be put out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
with you, Rasp, for making a fine effort to cheat me. You are
a baker; and you cannot help it.”</p>

<p>If any other man in Sunbury was proud of his honesty, so
was Rasp; and taking this speech as a compliment to it, he
smiled and pulled a paper-bag from his pocket, to receive the
best peach on the wall for his wife.</p>

<p>“What a difference one day’s sun has made! At one
time I doubted if they would colour, for it is the worst summer
I have known for many years. But they were all ready, as a
maiden is to blush, when she expects her sweetheart’s name.
With all my experience, I could scarcely have believed it;
what a change since Saturday! But ‘live and learn’ is the
gardener’s rule. <i>Galande</i>, the best peach of all, in my opinion,
is not yet ripe; but <i>Grosse Mignonne</i> is, and though rather
woolly in a year like ’57, it is first-rate in a cool season. Observe
the red spots near the caudal cavity—why bless my heart,
Rasp, I meant that for your wife!”</p>

<p>“My wife has a very sad toothache to-day, and she would
never forgive me if I made it worse. But what wonderful
things they are to run!”</p>

<p>This baker had a gentle streak of juice in either runnel of
his chin, which was shaped like a well-fed <i>fleur-de-lis</i>; and he
wiped it all dry with the face of the bag, upon which his own
name was printed.</p>

<p>“I knows a good thing, when I sees it; and that’s more
than a woman in a hundred does. Don’t believe they can
taste, or at least very few of them. Why, they’d sooner have
tea than a glass of good beer! Howsoever, that’s nought to do
with business. Mr. Orchardson, what’s your lowest figure?
With a wall of fruit coming on like them, sixpence apiece and
some thousands of them, you mustn’t be hard on a neighbour.”</p>

<p>My Uncle sat down on his four-legged stool (which had
bars across the feet, for fear of sinking, when the ground was
spongy), and he pulled his bag of vamp-leather to the middle
of his waistcoat, and felt for a shred and a nail. He had learned
that it never ends in satisfaction, if a man grows excited in
view of a bargain, or even shows any desire to deal. Then he
put up his elbow, and tapped the nail in, without hitting it
hard, as the ignorant do.</p>

<p>“Come, I’ll make a fair offer,” the baker exclaimed, for he
never let business do justice to itself; “an offer that you
might call handsome, if you was looking at it in a large point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of view. I’ll take fifty bushels at fifteen pence, pick ’em over
myself, for the pigs and the men; and if any crusty people turn
up, why here I am!”</p>

<p>“Rasp, you make a very great mistake,” said my Uncle,
turning round upon his stool, and confronting him with strong
honesty, “if you suppose that I have anything to do with the
use you make of my potatoes. I sell you my goods for the
utmost I can get, and you take good care that it is very little.
What you do with them afterwards is no concern of mine. I
owe you no thanks, and you know me not from Adam the
moment you have paid me. This is the doctrine of free-trade—you
recognize everything, except men.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what it is,” replied the baker; “sooner than vex
you, Mr. Orchardson, I’ll give sixteen pence all round, just as
they come out of the row. Who could say fairer than that
now?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen is the money. Not a farthing under. From all
that I can hear, it will be twenty pence to-morrow. Why,
here’s another fine peach fit to come! I shall send it to your
wife, and tell her you ate hers.”</p>

<p>The gardener merrily nailed away, while the baker was
working his hands for nothing. “You would never do such a
thing as that,” he said; “a single man have no call to understand
a woman; but he knows what their nature is, or why
did he avoid them? My wife is as good a woman as can be;
but none of them was ever known to be quite perfect. If it
must be eighteen, it must—and I’ll take fifty.”</p>

<p>“Ah, couldn’t I tell you a bit of news?” said the baker, as
he counted out the money. “You are such a silent man, Mr.
Orchardson, that a man of the world is afraid of you. And
the young fellow, your own nevvy—well, he may take after
you in speech, but not about the ladies—ah, you never would
believe it!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, keep it to yourself, that’s all. I don’t want
to hear a word against young Kit. And what’s more—if I
heard fifty, I wouldn’t believe one of them.”</p>

<p>“No more wouldn’t I. He’s as steady a young fellow as
ever drove a tax-cart. And so quiet in his manners, why, you
wouldn’t think that butter—”</p>

<p>“His mother was a lady of birth and breeding. That’s
where he gets his manners from; though there’s plenty in our
family for folk that deserve them. Out with your news, man,
whatever it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it don’t go again him much,” the baker replied,
with some fear—for my Uncle’s face was stern, and the wall-hammer
swung in his brown right hand; “and indeed you
might take it the other way, if he had done it all on his road
home from church. You know the bridge over the Halliford
brook, or at least where it was, for it’s all washed away, as you
heard very likely this morning. What right had your nevvy
there, going on for dark?”</p>

<p>My Uncle was a rather large-minded man; but without
being loose, or superior. “Rasp, if it comes to that,” he said,
“what right have you and I to be anywhere?”</p>

<p>“That’s neither here nor there,” answered the baker, having
always been a man of business; “but wherever I go, I pay my
way. However, your Kit was down there, and no mistake.
What you think he done? He punched Sam Henderson’s
head to begin with, for fear of him giving any help, and then
he jumped into the water, that was coming like a house on
fire from Tim Osborne’s dam, and out of it he pulled Mother
Marker, and the pretty young lady as had been in church.”</p>

<p>“Kit can swim,” said my Uncle shortly. “It is a very
dangerous trick to learn, being bound to jump in, whenever
any one is drowning. Did the women go in, for him to pull
them out?”</p>

<p>“Ah, you never did think much of them, Mr. Corny; but
you never had no inskin experience. Take ’em all round,
they are pretty nigh as good as we are. But they never
jumped in—no, you mustn’t say that. They were bound to
go home, and they were doing of it, till the flood took their
legs from under them. Mrs. Marker have been, this very
morning, conversing along of my good missus, and was likely
to stop when I was forced to come away, and you should hear
her go on about your Kit! And nobody knows if she has any
friends. I am told when her time comes to go to heaven, she
will have the disposal of four hundred pounds.”</p>

<p>“You be off to your wife!” cried Uncle Corny; “Mrs.
Marker is quite a young woman yet, but old enough to have
discovered what men are. Go to your work, Rasp. I hate
all gossip. But I am glad that Kit thrashed Sam Henderson.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>A LITTLE TIFF.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> knows, as he reads his newspaper, that nothing has
ever yet happened in the world with enough of precision and
accuracy to get itself described, by those who saw it, in the
same, or in even a similar manner. No wonder then that my
little adventure—if I have any right to call it mine—presented
itself in many different lights, not only to the people among
whom it spread, but even to the few who were present there
and then. Mrs. Jenny Marker’s account of what had happened
was already very grand that Sunday eve; but as soon as
she had slept and dreamed upon it, her great command of
words proved unequal to the call made at the same moment by
the mind and heart. Everybody listened, for her practice was
to pay every little bill upon a Monday morning; and almost
everybody was convinced that she was right.</p>

<p>“Miraculous is the only word that I can think of,” she
said to Mrs. Cutthumb, who sold tin-tacks and cabbages; “not
a miracle only of the sandy desert, but of the places where the
trees and waters grow.”</p>

<p>“The Jordan perhaps you means, Mrs. Marker, ma’am? Or
did you please to have in your mind the Red Sea?”</p>

<p>“They were both in my mind, and both come uppermost at
the same moment, Mrs. Cutthumb. But the best authorities
inform us now that we must not look for more than we can
understand. Yet I cannot understand how Kit Orchardson
contrived after pulling me out to pull out our Miss Kitty.
But look, here he comes! Why, he is everywhere almost.
He seems to swing along so. His uncle ought to work him
harder. Not that he is impudent. No one can say that of
him. Too bashful for a man, in my opinion. But he seems to
have taken such a liking to me; and I must be his senior by a
considerable time. I will go into your parlour, my dear Mrs.
Cutthumb, and then I can look out for our poor Miss Kitty—ah,
she is so very young, and no one to stand up for her!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss Marker, if you please,” said Mrs. Cutthumb;
“but if I may make so bold to say, you are very young
yourself, Miss, in years, though not in worship. And to be
run away with from school is a thing that may occur to any
girl when bootiful. But concerning of Miss Kitty—bless her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
innocent young face!—what you was pleased to say, ma’am,
is most surprising.”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Cutthumb, very far from that, when you come
to consider what human nature is. I never could do such
things myself; I never could sleep easy in my bed if I thought
that they ever could be imputed to me. But when we look at
things it is our duty to remember that the world is made up of
different people from what we are.”</p>

<p>“What experience you have had, ma’am, and yet keeping
your complexion so! Ah, if my poor Cutthumb could have
kept away from the imperial! But he said it were the duty of
a Briton, and he done it. Sally, get away into the back yard
with your dolly. I beg your pardon, ma’am, for interrupting
you of your words so.”</p>

<p>“Well, one thing I make a point of is,” Mrs. Marker continued
with a gentle frown, “never to enter into any domestic
affairs, though without any bias of any sort, out of doors. We
all have enough, as you know, Mrs. Cutthumb, and sometimes
more than we can manage, to regulate our own histories. Miss
Coldpepper is a remarkable lady, so very, so highly superior;
but her niece, our Miss Kitty, does not seem as yet to take
after her in that particular; and scarcely to be wondered at,
when you remember that she is not her niece at all of rights.
But this is not a question to interest you much, nor any one
outside of what I might call the Coldpepper domesticity.”</p>

<p>“What superior words you always do have, as it were, in
your muff, Mrs. Marker! But if you please to mean, Miss—being
still so young I slips into it naturally—the Coldpepper
Manor, why I was born upon it, and so was my parents before
me. And that makes it natural, as you might say, and proper
for me to have a word to say about them. I remember all the
Coldpeppers since I was that high; and it shall never go no
further.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to conceal. You must never fancy that
of them. The Coldpeppers always were a haughty race, and
headstrong; but bold, and outspoken, and defying of their
neighbours. It was bad for any one who crossed them: you
know that, if you remember old Squire Nicholas. But Miss
Kitty Fairthorn is not a Coldpepper. You see you don’t know
everything about them, Mrs. Cutthumb. The captain had
been married before he ever saw Miss Monica.”</p>

<p>“Lor’, Mrs. Marker, you quite take my breath away! And
yet I might have known it, I was bound almost to know it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the moment one comes to reflection. ‘Kitty’s’ not a name at
all becoming to the rank of the Manor of Coldpepper. I’ve
been wondering about it many’s the time; Arabella and Monica
sounds something like; but Kitty isn’t fit, except for women
that has to get their own livelihood. Well, it eases my mind
that she is not a Coldpepper.”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Cutthumb; but she is a Fairthorn; and from
all I hear the Fairthorns are much better known, in the great
world of London, than our Coldpeppers. Captain Fairthorn is
a man who has discovered more than the whole world knew in
our fathers’ days. He can make a bell ring in John o’ Groat’s
house, he can blow up a cliff at the Land’s End from London,
he knows every wrinkle at the bottom of the sea, he can make
a ghost stand at eight corners of the room.”</p>

<p>“Can he save his own soul, ma’am?” the greengrocer
asked in a solemn voice, being a strict Wesleyan. “Them
vanities, falsely called Science nowadays, is the depth of the
snare of the Evil One. A learned man knows all the bottom
of the sea, and leaves his own child to be drowned in a brook,
without it was for young Kit Orchardson. Can he save his
own soul, Mrs. Marker, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Well, if I was to go by guesswork, I should say that he
has not got very much of that to call his own. You know
what Miss Monica was; although she has been such a time
away from Sunbury. She took her first husband in spite of
her father, and the second without a word to anybody. She
had a son and two daughters by the Honourable Tom Bulwrag,
and within a year after him she carried off poor Captain,
who is now called Professor Fairthorn. But there, I am
told, though I never set eyes on him, being made up of telegraphs
and batteries, and magnesia, and a thing they call
hiderography, he is hardly ever at home for a week together,
and knows more about the ocean’s bed than about his own.
And a lucky thing for him; for wouldn’t she be a nagger, if
ever she could get the opportunity?”</p>

<p>“That seems to be most unnatural, and against the will of
the Almighty,” Mrs. Cutthumb replied after serious thought,
“that a lady should wish to reprove her husband, and yet find
no ear to put it into. With all his inventions for doing away
distance, he ought to be able to manage it.”</p>

<p>“It would make no difference, if he did, and could she
expect him to pay for it? His mind is so taken up when he
is at home, that she might as well go on at the bedpost. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
if he was to open up his wires, it would be at his discretion to
receive it all. This makes her rather harsh, as you can understand,
with any one that has no help for it. And our poor
Miss Kitty being always in the way, and a rival as it were to
her own children, oh she does know what pepper is, hot and
cold, and every colour!”</p>

<p>“Poor lamb! And she do look so innocent and sweet, and
so deserving of a real mother. No father to look after her, by
your own account, ma’am, and a step-mother doing it according
to her liking. Why don’t she run away, such a booty as
she is?”</p>

<p>“She is too sweet-tempered and well-principled for that.
And she thinks all the world of her father; all the more, no
doubt, because he cannot attend to her. His time is too precious
for him to mind his daughter. Not that he is money-making—far
the other way. Those great discoverers, as I
have heard say, are the last to discover the holes in their
pockets. Money, Mrs. Cutthumb has been too long discovered
for him to take any heed of it. And that makes another
source of trouble in the household. To think of our sending
the big carriage and two footmen, to find a young lady in the
third class at Feltham! I took care to keep it from Miss Coldpepper.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it would have been shocking,” cried the widow with
her hands up. “Why, the third class ain’t good enough for a
dead pig to drain in, any ways on the South-Western line.
Well, ma’am, and how did Miss Coldpepper take it?”</p>

<p>“Of these things I never speak out of the house. We are
liable to err, the very best of us, I believe, and I know it from
my own feelings. Those last twenty boxes of Star matches we
had from you, Mrs. Cutthumb, were stars, and no mistake.
Shooting stars they should be labelled. They go off like a
cannon, I have had to pay for three new aprons, and it was a
mercy they didn’t set the house afire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they hussies—they never know how to strike them;
and your Miss Coldpepper, she does change so often. Never
so much as a month, ma’am, without some of them giving
warning.”</p>

<p>“That is no concern of yours, Mrs. Cutthumb. If you
speak in this low style of Coldpepper Manor, it will have to
withdraw its custom, ma’am, from your—your little establishment.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenny Marker, as she spoke thus, gathered in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
jacket, which was plaited with blue velvet,—because she was
proud of her figure, or at least so some people said who could
not well get at her pockets—and although she meant no more
by this than to assert her own dignity, Mrs. Cutthumb, with all
the fine feelings of a widow, was naturally hurt, and showed it.
And strange enough to say, though it seems such a trifle, what
ensued made a very great difference to me.</p>

<p>“I am truly grieved, madam,” she said with a curtsey,
“that my little house, which is the best I can afford, and my
little shop, which was set up for me by very kind neighbours
as owned no manors, when it pleased the Almighty to afflict me
lo, and deprive me of a good man who could always pay his
sent, and never would allow me to be put upon—”</p>

<p>“A model husband, no doubt, Mrs. Cutthumb; except as I
fancy you observed just now, for his devotion to the imperial
pint,—or perhaps I should say gallon.”</p>

<p>“May you never have a worse, if you ever catches any!
And high time in life, ma’am, for you, Miss Jenny Marker, or
Mrs. whichever you may be, and nobody in Sunbury knows the
bottom of it, to be thinking a little now of your soul, ma’am,
and less of your body, and the other things that perish. You
draw in your cloak, ma’am, or it isn’t a cloak, nothing so suitable
and sensible as that, just as if my poor goods wasn’t good
enough to touch it! Perhaps that’s the reason why you beats
them down so. I beg you to remember, Jenny Marker, that I
consider myself as good as you are, madam, though I am not
tricked out with gew-gaws and fal-lals. And what I eats, I earns,
ma’am, and not the bread of servitude.”</p>

<p>“That will do, my good woman. I never lose my temper;
though I have never been insulted before like this, even by the
lowest people. Send in your little bill, this very afternoon, if
one of your wonderful neighbours will be good enough to make
it out for you, as you have never been taught to write, poor
thing! But whoever does it must not forget to deduct the price
of three rotten French eggs.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">While</span> that bitter war was raging, I enjoyed a peaceful and
gentle season. It happened that I had come up our village, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a matter of strict business, at a time of day not at all unlikely
to be the very time of day mentioned over-night, as the one
that would suit Mrs. Marker and Miss Fairthorn for doing a
little business in our village. This might be explained, without
any imputation on any one I have the pleasure of knowing, for
all of them will admit at once that it needs no explanation. It
is enough to say, that when I had the honour of seeing two ladies
safe home last night, after pulling them out of the flood—as
they both maintained, though never in it—no little gratitude
had been expressed, and much good-will had been felt all round.
And it would have been hard upon that state of things, if any
“Good-bye” had been said for ever.</p>

<p>For my part, although I had no great fear of being knocked
on the head by Sam Henderson, it might have seemed haughty
and even unfeeling, if I had insisted too strongly upon my
ability to take care of myself. Therefore I allowed them to
consider me in peril; and to this I was partly indebted perhaps
for the opportunity of meeting them on Monday. It is true
that I had not learned half as much, about matters of the
deepest interest to me, as Mrs. Cutthumb, without any claim
to such knowledge, was now possessed of; but this might fairly
be expected, for women have always been convinced that men
have no right to know half as much as themselves. “Let him
find it out, I am not going to tell him,” is their too frequent
attitude, while they feel it a duty to their own sex to pour out
almost everything.</p>

<p>However, I have no desire to complain, and perhaps it is
better thus; for if we knew all of their affairs, we might think
less about them. And I was in a very deep condition of
interest and wonder, not only from the hints I had received,
but also from the manifold additions of my fancy. In fact, it
was far more than I could do, to confine my heart to its proper
work when I saw those two ladies come to do a little shopping.</p>

<p>At that time, there were only about a dozen of the houses,
in the narrow street that runs along the river, which allowed
the importance of selling to compete with the necessity of
dwelling. And the few, that did appear inclined to do a little
trade, if coaxed into it, were half ashamed of their late concession
to the spirit of the age. No man had yet appeared
who shatters the ancestral sense of congruity, who routs up the
natives, as a terrier bullies mastiffs, and scarcely even leaves
them their own bones. And it may be maintained, that people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
got things better, and found them last longer than they ever do
now. And this was only natural, because it always took a much
longer time to buy them.</p>

<p>This enabled me to take my time about my own business,
without any risk of being left behind by the lady housekeeper
and her fair companion. From time to time I assured myself
by a glance between flower-pots, or among drapery, that my
quest was not gone astray, that as yet I had not lost all that I
cared to see, and that I could keep in my own background,
while thinking of things far beyond me.</p>

<p>It never had been my manner yet to be much afraid of anything;
not that I stood at all upon my valour, but simply because,
to the best of my knowledge, I had no enemy anywhere. Yet
now, very much to my own surprise, instead of proper courage,
I was full of little doubts, and more misgivings than I can at
all describe, and even a tendency to run away, and try to forget
the very thing I was longing for. And I knew for a certainty
that if the matter came to the very best opportunity, I was
quite sure to do my very worst, and cut a despicable figure, to
my own undoing.</p>

<p>I tried to recover myself, by doing a few strokes of business
on my own account, going into the butcher’s, and complaining
sadly that he now weighed the foot in with the leg of mutton—a
privilege only to be claimed by lamb—but he said that it
now was ordained by nature, and asked how I expected a poor
sheep to walk. I knew that his logic would not go upon all-fours,
but my wits were so loose that I let it pass; and at that
very moment I discovered, betwixt the hearts of two bullocks,
something very near my own. Miss Kitty Fairthorn had been
set free by Mrs. Jenny Marker, while the housekeeper was
driving a bargain in soft goods, unfit for young comprehension.
After that, she was to go on for a talk with Widow Cutthumb,
and meanwhile the young lady might look at the river, which
was now rolling grandly in turbulent flood.</p>

<p>It was rather a shy and a delicate thing for me to go also in
that direction; and the butcher (who never confined his
attention to his own mutton) was as sure as could be to come
out of his door, and look all up the lane. For Sunbury people,
as long as I have known them, take a deep interest in one
another’s doings; and all the more so, when they happen to
perceive that their sympathy is not requested. Wherefore I
hurried back to ask another question, as if there were nothing
in my mind but meat, and then turned up an alley, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
would lead me round the back of some houses to the Halliford
Road further on.</p>

<p>There were many things now that I might have done, more
sensible haply than what I did. I might have gone home, and
had bread and cheese, and a glass of mild ale with Uncle
Corny; or if that had seemed a little too ignoble, why not
wander along the upper road, and thence survey, as from a
terrace—which used to be the origin of the word “contemplate”—the
many distant mazes of the flooded river, the trees
along the margin bowing over their foundations, the weak smile
of autumnal sunshine over the wrongs of its own neglect, and
perhaps in the foreground a slender figure, standing as if it
were nothing in the mass?</p>

<p>However, what I did was to go straight on towards the one
in the world who was all the world to me. By what process of
reason, or unreason, or pure stupid heart, I was come in such
haste to this state of mind, is more than I can explain to any,
and I did not even try to explain it to myself. There was my
condition, right or wrong; and those who cannot understand it
may be proud of their cool wisdom; and I without harm may
be sorry for them.</p>

<p>She wore a grey cloak looking wonderfully simple, yet
gathered in small at her beautiful waist, and trimmed at the
skirts, and over two little pockets, with a soft blue fur called
Vicunha. And she carried a little muff of the same material,
and the strings of her hat (which was like a sea-shell) were also
of a blue tint very sweetly matching. But the blue that was
sweetest and richest of all was that of her large, soft, loving
eyes, than which it is impossible for any poet to imagine anything
in heaven more lovely.</p>

<p>However, I shall not go on any more about her, though
things may slip out unawares; and without being rude, I may
say plainly, that I have a right to keep such matters to myself.
For a short time, I was at a loss for the commonest presence of
mind, and stood wondering; hoping that she would turn
round, and yet fearing that she might think I had no business
there. Her whole attention was taken up, as I knew by her
attitude—for already I seemed to have a gift of understanding
her—not with any thought of people near her, but with the
grandeur of the rolling flood, and the breadth of quiet lake
beyond it. She was saying to herself—so far as I could tell—“What
is the use of such a little dot as I am, and what is
the value of my little troubles, when the mighty world goes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
like this, and all I can do would not make a wrinkle and
scarcely a flutter on the vast expanse?”</p>

<p>Then suddenly, an if in dread of her own thoughts, she
turned round and saw me within a landyard of her. As if she
had been taken in a rosy fog—for we are all ashamed of large
thoughts, when caught in them—she coloured to the tint of
one of Uncle Corny’s peaches, though without any of the spots
he was so proud of; and then she drew one hand from her
blue muff, and I found it so soft and warm and precious, that
I almost forgot to let it go again.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I am surprised to see you here!” she said, as if
my general place of residence was the moon; and probably I
looked as if it should be so.</p>

<p>“And I am even more amazed to see you here,” I answered
without any of my wits to help me, “but I came to do a little
bit of business with the butcher. He has been doing things he
had no right to do.”</p>

<p>“I have often been told that they are inclined to take
advantage,” she replied, with a look which convinced me at
once that she would make a first-rate housekeeper, for what
butcher could resist it? “My dear father would have much
trouble with them, if, if—I mean if he were at all allowed to
have it. But he is always so full of great things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a happy man he must be! I have heard that
he is the most clever, and learned, and one of the most celebrated
men in London.”</p>

<p>I may not have heard all that, but still I was perfectly
justified in saying it, for it made her talk; and every time
she spoke, her voice sounded sweeter than it did the time
before.</p>

<p>“You have been told the truth; it is acknowledged
universally,” she went on as if there were no fame to equal his,
and with a sparkle in her blue eyes, as if a star had flashed in
heaven; “there seems to be nothing that he does not know,
and nothing that he does not improve by his knowledge, and
make useful for—I mean for the world at large. How I can be
his child, and yet so stupid and slow-witted, is a thing that
amazes me, and I am trying always not to think of it.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you are not stupid. I am sure you are very
quick-witted. I never saw any one half so clever, and accomplished,
and ladylike, and gentle, and”—“lovely” was the
word I was about to use; but she stopped me, with a smile
that would have stopped a rushing bull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am showing my quick wits now,” she said, presenting
the charm of her hand again, “by never even thanking you for
all you did last evening. I was thinking before you appeared,
that but for you I should probably be tossing in these wild
waters now, or probably carried down as far as London Bridge,
without a chance even of being buried. And it made me so
sad, when I remembered that it would make no difference to
any one.”</p>

<p>“How can you say such a dreadful thing?” I exclaimed
with great indignation, for her eyes that had been so full of
light were darkened with sadness, and turned away; “it is
not true that I saved you in the least, though I wish that I
had; I should deserve to live for ever; but you speak as if no
one in the world had any love for the sweetest, and best, and
most lovely creature in it.”</p>

<p>This was going rather far, I must confess; not that any
word of it was at all exaggerated, or even approached the proper
mark; but that it might seem a little early, on the part of one
who had never had the pleasure of beholding the lady, till the
previous afternoon. The remembrance of this was very awkward
to me, and I was wild with myself, but could not stop the
mischief now.</p>

<p>“Will you oblige me, Mr. Orchardson,” she asked, as gently
as if I had shown no folly, “by just looking down or up the
village, to see if Mrs. Marker is coming. She was to have been
here ten minutes ago; and we have to make a long round now,
since the bridge on the lower road is washed away. I ought
not to trouble you; but I never know exactly where I am in
country places, although I love the country so.”</p>

<p>This was more than I deserved; for a good box on the ears
was the proper reward for my frowardness, and I should have
been less abashed by it. “I am a bigger cad than Sam
Henderson himself,” I whispered with a timid glance at her.
But she seemed at a loss to know what my meaning was; and
so with a deep but very clumsy bow, I departed to do her
bidding.</p>

<p>Before I had taken many steps, there appeared the lady
housekeeper in the distance, walking with great dignity,
perhaps to console herself for the insolence of that Widow
Cutthumb. Of this I knew nothing as yet, though it was
plain that something unrighteous had disturbed her. And this
made my humble demeanour more soothing and persuasive to
her upright mind. After shaking her hand very warmly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
paying a well-deserved compliment to her fine colour, I ventured
to implore a little favour, which the sight of our garden wall
sparkling in the sunshine, for it was newly topped with broken
glass, suggested by some good luck to me.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you would only come,” I said, “and see my Uncle’s
trees to-morrow! They are at their very best this week, before
we begin to gather largely. The pears are hanging down, so that
we have had to prop the branches, and the plums are as thick
as eggs together, when the hen is sitting; only instead of being
pale, some are of the richest gold, and some of a deep purple,
like—like that magnificent amethyst you wear; and the peaches
on the wall—you might almost compare these to a lady’s cheeks,
when a gentleman tells her of her beauty—”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Orchardson, you are quite a poet!”</p>

<p>“And when you get tired of looking at them, and tasting
the ripest, all you have to do is to come into the vinery, and
sit beneath the leaves, and look all along it, wherever the
clusters leave any room to look, until you don’t know which
you like the best, the appearance of the black or the white
ones, because so much depends upon the light. And then
Uncle Corny comes with a pair of scissors, and says—‘Ma’am,
that is not the way to look at it. The proof of the pudding is
in the eating,’ and he hands you in a vine-leaf, being careful
where he cuts it, a jet-black shoulder of Black Hamburgh, and
an amber-coloured triplet of White Muscat.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Orchardson, you are making my mouth water, if a vulgar
expression may be allowed to one who eats the bread of
servitude.” I wondered to hear her speak thus, though I saw
that she had been aggrieved by somebody. “And if you will
be at home to-morrow afternoon, perhaps I might obtain permission
to leave my mistress for an hour or two. I might
walk down about four o’clock, when I have finished all the
blacking of the boots.”</p>

<p>Something with a spiteful tang to it was rankling in her
mind, as I perceived; but having no right to ask, I just lifted
my hat and gazed at her gold chain and broach. Then a tear
or two, started by her own words, came forth, and she looked
at me softly.</p>

<p>“You would add to the favour of your invitation,” she said
with a smile which made me look at something else, “if you
would include in it Miss Kitty Fairthorn. Poor thing! She
is put upon very sadly, and it would be such a treat for her.
They see so little of the beauties of nature in London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sure my Uncle will be most happy;” I answered as
if I were not sure about myself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>DE GUSTIBUS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> my Uncle Cornelius Orchardson (a stout and calm fruit-grower,
called in contumely “Corny the topper” by strangers
who wanted his growth for nothing) professed and even practised
a large contempt for gossip. Nevertheless it was plain
enough that his feelings were hurt, if a thing went on, which
he was bound in politeness to know, and yet was not offered
any tidings of it. With such people it is always wiser, if you
have done anything against their wishes, to let them know all
the particulars at once; and so to have it out and be done with it.
And I was beginning to love him now, which as a boy I had
done but little, inasmuch as he never gave way to me.
Obstinate as he was, and sometimes hot—if one tried to play
tricks with him—I was not much afraid of Uncle Corny,
although so dependent upon him. For I knew him to be a
just man in the main, and one who kept no magnet of his own
to fetch down the balance to his own desires. Yea, rather he
would set the beam against himself, when it trembled in doubt
of its duty.</p>

<p>With the hasty conclusions of youth, I believed that because
he was now an old bachelor, though able to afford a wife many
years ago, he had taken and held to an adverse view of the
fairer and better half of the human race. And his frequent
counsels to me to keep out of their way confirmed my conviction.
The course of time proved that I was wrong in this, as
in many other matters of my judgment; and my rule, if I had
to begin again, would be to think the best of every man, till
he compels me otherwise. But the worst of Uncle Corny was
that he never cared to vindicate himself.</p>

<p>His countenance also was in keeping with this manner, and
the build of his body and the habit of his gait. His figure
was tall, yet wide and thick, and his face very solid and ample.
He had never been comely by line and rule, yet always very
pleasant for an honest man to look at, and likely to win the
good word of a woman. Because there was strength and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
decision in his face, and a power of giving full meaning to his
words, which were generally short and to the purpose. And
especially he was gifted with a very solid nose, not of any
Roman or Grecian cast, but broadly English, and expansive,
and expressive, and sometimes even waggish when he told an
ancient tale.</p>

<p>Knowing that he would be quite sure to hear of my adventures
soon, even if he had not heard already—for Sunbury is a
fine place for talk—and trusting to his better feelings (which
were always uppermost after a solid supper, when he stirred
his glass of hot rum and water, and had his long pipe lit for
him), I began upon him that very night with what my mind
was full of. For Tabby Tapscott was now gone home, after
looking at me rather queerly.</p>

<p>“What a knowledge of the world you have, Uncle Corny!”
I exclaimed at the end of his favourite tale concerning Covent
Garden; “your advice must be worth more than the counsel of
the cleverest lawyer in London.”</p>

<p>“More honest at least, and no fee to pay,” he answered
rather testily, for he hated all humbug and compliments.
“What have you been at, young man? Is it my advice, or my
aid, you want?”</p>

<p>“A little of both; or a lot of one, and a little of the other.
I have made the acquaintance of a sweet young lady, the
gentlest, and loveliest, and most graceful, and modest, and
elegant, and accomplished, and lofty-minded, and noble-hearted,
and—and—”</p>

<p>“Angelic, angelic is the word, Kit—don’t begrudge it; it
saves such a lot of the others.”</p>

<p>“Yes, angelic,” I replied with firmness; “and even that is
not half good enough. You know nothing of such matters,
Uncle Corny.”</p>

<p>“Then what is the use of my advice? You had better go
to Tabby Tapscott.”</p>

<p>This threw me out a little; but I would not be brow-beaten.</p>

<p>“If you have no wish to hear any more about her, and compare
her to an old creature like Tabby, all I can say is that I
am sorry for your taste, very sorry for your taste, Uncle Corny.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, go on, Kit. Let us have it all, while we are
about it. Rasp the baker told me something. He has brought
down a girl from London who can make short bread and
maids of honour. No wonder you fell in love with her.”</p>

<p>“You may try to provoke me, but you shall not succeed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
because you know no better. What will you say when I tell
you the young lady is the niece of Miss Coldpepper of Coldpepper
Manor?”</p>

<p>I looked at Uncle Corny with a glance of triumph; and
then stood up, to breathe again, after my own audacity. But
instead of being terrified, he took it very coolly.</p>

<p>“Well, a cat may look at a king,” said he, pursuing his
pipe with his usual discretion; “and I suppose you have only
looked at her; though somebody said you pulled her out of
our watercress brook.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I have had two delightful talks with her; and I mean
to have another to-morrow. Not that I have any hope—of
course, I am well aware—”</p>

<p>“That you are unworthy to worship her shoe-string, and lie
down for her peg-heels to tread on. If she likes you, I don’t
see why you shouldn’t have her. By-and-by, I mean, when
you get a little wiser. But has the girl got any money?”</p>

<p>“I hope not; I hope not, from the bottom of my heart.
It would be yet another obstacle. She is as high above me,
as the heaven is above the earth, without—without even a
penny in her pockets.”</p>

<p>“Flies all the higher, because her pockets are so light.”
He spoke with a jocosity, which appeared to me most vulgar.
“Don’t look as if you longed to knock me over, Kit. By the
way, I heard that you had floored Sam Henderson. If so, you
deserve the best maid that ever looked into a looking-glass.
What do you want me to do, my lad? I know a little of those
people.”</p>

<p>I wondered what people he meant, but feared to ask him for
the moment, lest I might lose the chance of getting the favour
I had set my heart on. “It is a very simple thing,” I said,
“and need not take your time up. Mrs. Marker is longing to
see your garden; and if she may come to-morrow afternoon,
she will bring the young lady, and I can show them round.
You need not stir a step, or even turn your head.”</p>

<p>“It is quite enough to have one head turned. They may
come, if they choose, but they must not bother me. Hand me
the jar of tobacco, Kit, and be off to the books, instead of
spooning.”</p>

<p>My uncle might easily have taken a more ample and
cordial view of the question; still I was pleased not to find him
worse, and ordered our crock-boy on the Tuesday morning to
fetch a little round while he ate his breakfast, and leave a note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
for Mrs Marker at the lodge of the Coldpepper grounds, near
the dairy, which the housekeeper visited early. And then I
went to gather, and basket a quarter of Keswick codlin and
Quarantines. This occupied all the forenoon, and what with
seeing that they were picked aright, and sorted into firsts
and seconds, and fairly packed, with no rubbish at the bottom, into
bushel-baskets, and yet presented smiling with their eyes
upward to meet the gaze of the purchaser, the day went so fast
that it was dinner-time, before I could sit down, and dwell
upon my heart. Then at a reproachful glance from Selsey Bill,
our orchard foreman, who had heard the church clock strike
one, and felt it to the depths of his capable stomach, I set three
fingers to my teeth, and blew the signal, which is so welcome
to the men who have lived upon nothing but hope, ever since
half-past eight o’clock.</p>

<p>It is not to be denied, however, that I had taken pretty
sharp advantage of being well mounted from time to time on
the upper rungs of a ladder, which gave me command of the
Halliford Road—the higher road, I mean, for the lower now
was stopped and except to carts and carriages—in such a manner
that none could come from that part of the world, without my
knowledge. Seeing only a pedlar and some few women (highly
interesting to themselves no doubt, but not concerning my
state of mind), I went in to dine with Uncle Corny, and took
care to eat none of his onions.</p>

<p>“What cheeks you have got, Kit!” he cried with a laugh;
“and it is not from eating too much dinner. You have stolen
the colour of my Quarantines. Eat, boy, eat; or how will
you pull through it? No more visits from young ladies, if you
are to go off your head like this. You have put the new
mustard-spoon into the salt. A pretty muddle, I’m afraid,
among my apples.”</p>

<p>Being always very dutiful, I let him have his grumble; and
presently he lit his pipe, and made off for the packing-shed,
though the load was not going till to-morrow night. Then I
put myself into a little better trim, feeling that the best I did
could never make me fit to look round the corner of a wall at
somebody. Although I was considered in our village a smart
and tidy and well-built young fellow, and one of the girls at the
linendraper’s had sent me a Valentine last spring, said to be of
her own composition, beginning—“Thou noble and majestic
youth, Thy curls and thy ruddy cheeks proclaim the truth,
That whenever I think of thee, I have a sigh, And if thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
provest false, I shall jump into the Thames and die!” But it
was in vain for me to think of this at present; it gave me no
support at all worth having; and even a book of poetry, which
I put into my pocket, might just as well have been the list of
pots and pans from Turnham Green.</p>

<p>Before I could get into any real courage, there came a
gentle double knock, as if from the handle of a parasol, at the
green door near the corner of the wall, and then a little laugh;
and then a sweet voice said, “Oh, Jenny, don’t you think we
had better go back? Are you sure that Auntie said that I
might come?” In dread of further doubts, I ran up promptly,
and opened the door, and brought them in, and locked it.</p>

<p>“This young lady,” began Mrs. Marker, as if they were
come for her sake only, “has never seen any fruit-garden,
fruit-orchard, fruit-establishment, or whatever the proper name
is. And I thought perhaps before she goes back to London,
this would enlarge her store of knowledge; and her father, who is
a very learned man, might like to hear her account of it. Now
keep your eyes open, Miss Kitty, and see all. You would
fancy that she noticed nothing, Mr. Orchardson, by the way
she goes on, and her quietness. And yet when you come to
talk afterwards, it turns out that nothing has escaped her blue
eyes; and she can tell ten times as much as I can, and I am
considered pretty accurate too. But we must pay our respects
to your Uncle, Mr. Cornelius Orchardson. I always like to do
the proper thing. Business first, and pleasure afterwards.”</p>

<p>“He will smile, when he hears how you have put it. He
is very busy now at the packing-shed. But he told me to take
you wherever you liked; and he will come down, when he
has made out his list. On the left you have the peach-wall, and
on the right the plums; and the figs are getting very ripe down
this alley. We very seldom eat much fruit ourselves, because
we have such a lot of it. But we always long to get ladies’
opinions, because of the delicacy of their taste.”</p>

<p>“It is a perfect shame,” said Mrs. Marker, while making
up her mind what to begin with, “that, in such a Paradise, there
should be no lady, to give you the knowledge of good and evil.
I brought a silver knife with me, in case of being tempted.
Not that I mean to taste anything of course, unless my opinion
should be absolutely required. My constitution is not strong,
Mr. Kit; and I am compelled to be very careful.”</p>

<p>I knew what was meant by that, having heard it often.
“You shall have nothing, madam, but the very best,” I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
answered; “for we never throw away an opportunity like this.
What shall we offer first for your judgment?”</p>

<p>“Kitty, what do you say?” She turned as if in doubt.
“You know, my dear, how careful we must be. This young
lady, Mr. Kit, allows me to call her ‘Kitty,’ in our private
moments. Kit and Kitty—what a very strange coincidence!”</p>

<p>I could not help looking at the beautiful Miss Fairthorn;
and to my eyes she became more beautiful than ever. For a
deep blush spread upon her lovely cheeks, and she turned
away, and said, “I leave it quite to you.”</p>

<p>If Mrs. Marker had been planning all the morning how to
get the best of the tasting to herself, and to render her
judgment supreme, she could hardly have hit upon a better
device than this. For her young companion became so nervous
and so much confused, and I myself so diffident and deeply
occupied, that our only object was to fill the lady housekeeper’s
mouth, and keep it running over with nothing worse than
fruit. Now and then I ventured to steal a glance at the one
with whom my heart was filled, as if to ask whether she would
ever forgive me for my sad name of Kit. But her eyes were
afraid to encounter mine; or if by any chance they did so, the
light that was in them wavered like a timid gleam pursued by
cloud. To relieve this trouble, I began to chatter vague
nonsense to the other visitor, who was falling to in earnest.</p>

<p>“Everything is out of time this year, and nothing up to
character. There has been no sunshine on this wall, until you
ladies shone upon it; and what amazes me most is to find that anything
has any colour at all. Here is a Grosse Mignonne now, a
week ago as green as a leek, and covered now with downy crimson,
except just where a leaf has made a pale curve across it, like the
pressure of a finger on your cheek. Taste it, Mrs. Marker; you
are not getting on at all.”</p>

<p>“Let me see, that makes seven, I think. I shall have lost
my taste before we get among the gages. Thank you, I am
sure. Oh, how lovely, and delicious! Luscious perhaps is the
better expression. There goes ever so much more juice on my
dress. I ought to have brought a bib, Mr. Kit; and I will, if
I ever come again. But would not you say it was just the least
thought woolly?” She had never heard of such a thing before,
but I had taught her, and she was growing critical. “Kitty
dear, you are tasting nothing. Don’t you consider that just an
atom woolly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very likely it is. I don’t know enough to say. But I
never remember tasting wool, with so fine a flavour in it.”</p>

<p>Perhaps I was not in a proper mood to judge; but verily
this appeared to me to show an inborn aptitude for taking the
management of the fruit, and the government of the grower.
To exaggerate is altogether out of my nature, and I find it a
great mistake to be ecstatic; but in spite of all that, I would
have given every sixpence allowed me by my Uncle Corny—who
was always afraid of allowing me too much—if only I could
have conveyed to this exquisite judge my opinion of her sentence.
But that blessed discovery of Mrs. Marker’s about the
everlasting fitness of our names,—upon which I had been dwelling
in my heart, long before her stupid slowness blurted it—this,
I say, had acted in a very awkward manner upon a mind
infinitely higher than hers; and yet I hoped humbly that it
might suggest something, which might be for the best, if let
alone.</p>

<p>Things being so, it was not at all amiss that a loud voice
reached us from the clipped yew-hedge, which was set across to
break the north winds here—“Kit, where the deuce are you
gone mooning? I thought you would have come up with the
ladies, long ago.”</p>

<p>“Here we are, looking from a distance at your peaches. Oh,
Mr. Orchardson, how lovely they do seem!” Mrs. Marker lost
her dignity by giving me a wink, believing as she did—and
many others thought the same—that I was next to nobody in
these gardens, and my Uncle a tiger over every fruit he grew.</p>

<p>“We have had as many peaches as we can eat, sir,” I said,
without any wish to contradict her, but simply to show the
position I held.</p>

<p>“Ladies will excuse my present plight;” he had no coat on,
and his sleeves were tucked up, showing a pair of thick brown
arms. “My peaches are very poor this year, and many have
split their stones, and rot instead of ripening. We have not
had such a season since 1852. I hope you will not judge us by
the wretched things you see. But come on a little further, and
try something else. All fruit is water, such a year as we have
had. But possibly I may find a plum or two worth eating.”</p>

<p>“Allow me the pleasure, sir,” said Mrs. Marker, who always
insisted on proper forms, “of introducing you to Miss Fairthorn,
the only daughter of Captain, or as he now is considered,
Professor Fairthorn—a gentleman of the highest scientific
tendencies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Uncle Corny, as he took his hat off, and
smiled with surprise at her beauty; “I knew Captain Fairthorn,
years ago, and a very noble man he is. I have very good
cause to remember him—but I will not trouble you with that
now. Mrs. Marker, if you would just turn this corner—take
care of your most becoming bonnet, young lady”—this pleased
the good housekeeper more than twenty plums,—“our trees are
not as sensitive as we are.”</p>

<p>His urbanity amazed me, for I never could have thought
a good man could be so inconsistent; and I said to myself that
after all there is something irresistible in women. So I ventured
to sidle up to Miss Fairthorn, as he led the way with his
convoy, and asked her what she thought of him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think he is so nice,” she replied smiling at me, as if
she was pleased with my question; “so upright, and manly,
and such a fine countenance. No wonder, I’m sure, that his
fruit is good.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice how much he was surprised at you, at your
very pretty dress, and exceedingly sweet smile, and most ladylike
appearance, and silvery voice, and lovely—lovely way of
holding your parasol?”</p>

<p>“How can you talk such nonsense, Mr. Orchardson? And
your Uncle appears such a sensible man! Dear me, we are losing
all the wise things he can say. Let us hurry on—it was this
way, I think.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Don’t you hear their voices down this path? Not
twenty yards off, if it were not for these trees. Oh, do let me
carry your parasol. You will want both hands to get along.
Before you know where we are, we shall be in the broad road.
Oh, I am so sorry—it was all my fault. You must let me undo
the mischief I have done. May I show you how well I understand
all roses?”</p>

<p>By good luck, combined with some little skill of mine, her
simple yet wholly adorable frock was captured in three places
by gooseberries whom I envied. I expected great delight from
this. But she showed at once the sweetness of her temper, and
her height above me. Instead of blushing stupidly, she smiled,
and said—“Thank you, I will do it for myself. You can hardly
be expected to understand such things.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>BAD COUNSEL.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> are very few things that have the power to please us both
in heart and mind, even when they have the will to do it, which
is very seldom. Great events in our lives flash by without a
word, and scarcely seem to give us time to chuckle, or to sob,
till afterwards. But the little turns of time are more indulgent,
and pass us with a sauntering foot, more often dull than lightsome.</p>

<p>For the moment, I was glad to find that my Uncle Cornelius,
in his plain way, had taken a liking to my love. But I gave
him little credit for it, inasmuch as it seemed impossible to me
that he could do otherwise. Such was my petty jealousy that
I did not even want to hear him praise her, except in my own
words. But he, in his solid way, would take his own view of
her character—as if he knew anything about it!</p>

<p>“I don’t care a farthing about all that,” I cried, when he
had spoken of some things, which tell the longest.</p>

<p>“I can see she is very quiet, and full of home affections,”
he persisted, as if I were a boy at school, and he were holding
the spelling book; “she is not extravagant, nor fond of waste;
that I saw by the way she went through a ‘Huling’s Superb,’
with a hole in it. I could scarcely have done it any better
myself. And she was really grieved, which the lady-housekeeper
had not the sense to be, by the freedom—she called it
recklessness—with which I picked those Jeffersons, to find one
in tip-top condition. And then when I offered to make some
tea, the housekeeper who had been stuffing for hours only asked
if the water was boiling. But your sweetheart began to
buckle up, and asked who could touch tea, after such delicious
things.”</p>

<p>“Buckle up, indeed! Uncle Corny, you are outrageous.
She had got no such thing as a buckle near her. Her waist is
done round with a narrow blue ribbon, the colour of the sky, as
her eyes are. And I will thank you not to call her my sweetheart,
if you please. I shall never have such luck. And it
sounds so common. There ought to be a better expression for
it. And such things are not made to be talked of.”</p>

<p>“Very well! You won’t hear me say another word. It
will all come to nothing; that’s one comfort. She goes back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to London on Friday; and you will very soon console yourself
with Rasp’s young woman. I am told that she has fine black
eyes; and I am not sure that black don’t beat blue ones, after all.”</p>

<p>This was so disgusting that I went away, and worked till
dusk at a heavy piece of trenching; and when it was dusk I
lay in wait for three felonious boys who came from Hampton,
almost every evening, prowling for our apples. I caught all
three, and trounced them well—which is the only proper plan—and
the sound of their wailings, as they went home, restored
my faith in justice. For I had given them their choice—“a
licking or a summons”—and they said very justly, “Oh, a licking,
if you please, sir.” The world has now come to such a pass,
that a father would summon me for assault, if I so discharged
his duty for him; but thirty years ago a bit of common sense
survived.</p>

<p>But in spite of that little satisfaction, I could not get much
sleep that night, for rolling, and pondering, and twisting
in and out, the tangle and the burden of a troubled mind.
Turn it as I might, there was no opening through it for another
view of that perfect creature, with whom my whole life seemed
to flow. Terrible, terrible was the truth that she would leave
us all on Friday, and be swallowed up and no more seen, in
that great earthquake, London. A thousand wild ideas, and
schemes, for stealing yet one more interview, and countless
crazy hopes that she herself might try to compass it, all came
thrilling through my restless brain, but not one would stop
there. None had any shape or substance, such as could be
worked upon, and brought to likelihood of success. This was
Tuesday night; last Saturday night how different everything
had been! Then I had only cared to know, that things in
the ground were doing well, that all the fruit which required
gathering got its due, and looked its best on its way to be
devoured, that every man pocketed his wages in good time to
spend them, and that there was a little hope of the weather
taking up at last. Now there had been three days without rain,
and with touch of autumnal sunshine; heaven began to look
bright again, and the earth (which, like the dwellers therein,
lives only aright in view of it) was beginning to lift her sodden
crust, and fetch once more her storm-trampled breath and issue
anew the genial green in the midrib of mouldy foliage. In a
word, the summer which had failed the year, for want of a
smile to lead it, was breaking out at this last moment, better
late than never.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Possessed as I was with my own troubles, and only a
flickering sunshine, I could not resist the contagious lightness
of cheerful faces all around. The workmen, who do (in spite
of all British reserve, and manly selfishness) take a deep interest
in their employer’s welfare, and stand up for him bravely,
when any one abuses him, except themselves—every man of
them laid heel to spade, or hoisted ladder on shoulder, with new
briskness; because they could say to one another—“The old
buffer, who carries on this place, has fought against long odds
like a man; and now things look as if they was taking a little
turn in his favour.”</p>

<p>On the Wednesday morning glum however was my mind,
and grim my face, and Uncle Corny made some jokes, which
may have seemed very good to him. Our breakfast things
were set as usual, and our breakfast cooked and served by Mrs.
Tabby Tapscott, that sage widow from the village, whom we
were often pleased to laugh at for her Devonshire dialect.
Also for her firm conviction, that nothing in these outlandish
parts, and none of our biggest men, were fit to compare with
the products of the West. There was one point however on
which we gladly confessed the truth that was in her—she
could fry potatoes, not leathery chips, nor the cake of pulpy
fatness, but the crisp yet melting patin of brown gold, so as
none of the East may fry them. She turned them out of the
frying-pan upon a willow-pattern plate, and the man deserved
to wear the willow, who could think of weeping near
them.</p>

<p>Now this good woman, who was a “cure,” as the slang boys
of our village said, took (though I knew it not as yet) a tender
interest in my affairs. For the last day or two, I had observed
that she glanced at me rather strangely, and once or twice behind
my Uncle’s back, she had put her finger on her lips, and
then jerked her thumb over her shoulder, as if to say—“Come
and have a quiet word with me.”</p>

<p>But my frame of mind had appeared to me too noble and
exalted to be shared with her, until it was come to such a pitch
that any aid would be welcome.</p>

<p>This morning, as half of her fine work remained on my
plate neglected, she could no longer contain herself, but pinched
my sleeve and whispered, while my Uncle was going to the
window, “Come out in gearden, I want to spake to ’e.”</p>

<p>“Speak away,” I answered, “there is nothing to stop you,
Mrs. Tapscott;” but she looked at me and muttered that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was just a fool, and she had a mind to have nought to do with
me.</p>

<p>By the common law of nature, this made me long to hear
what on earth she could have to say, and I gave her the chance,
while she washed up the things, to see where I was, and to
come out if she pleased. She might do exactly as she pleased,
for I did not intend to encourage her. She came out, and
began without asking me.</p>

<p>“I can’t abide to zee ’e look so crule weist and peaky. The
toorn of your nose bain’t the zame as her was, and you don’t
zim at home with your vittels, Measter Kit. Lor’ bless ’e, I
been droo the zame my zen, and I knaws arl about ’en.”</p>

<p>At first I was inclined to walk away; but it would have
been shabby to be rude to her, and a look of good-will and
kindly pity was in her hard-worn eyes and face. “What can
you have to say to me?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You be young, and I be old,” she took my coat to stop
me; “you be peart and nimble, and I be a’most crippled with
rheumatics and rumbago. But the Lord hath made us arl alike,
though He have given us different. I knows as wull what ails
’e now, as if it arl coom droo my own heart. And what you
be zaying to yourzelf is—‘How be I to goo on with it’?”</p>

<p>This was a wonderfully accurate description of my present
state of mind. I looked at Mrs. Tapscott, with the admiration
she deserved, and said—“Well then, how be I to goo on with
it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve athought ’un out,” she made answer bravely; “what
you be bound to do, Measter Kit, is never to let she goo back
to Lunnon, wi’out zettling zummat.”</p>

<p>Here was the whole of it in a nutshell. But how was I to
settle anything?</p>

<p>“Oh, Tabby, dear Tabby!” I cried, with some loss of
dignity, but much gain of truth; “how can I even get the
chance of saying a word to her again? This is Wednesday,
and she goes back on Friday, and perhaps she never comes
again, and there are millions of people between us. Everybody
knows what Miss Coldpepper is, as proud as Punch, and as stiff
as starch. If I even dared to go near the house, she’d just tell
the gamekeeper to shoot me.”</p>

<p>“Wull, a young man as have vallen in love must take his
chance of shot-guns. But if so be you latts her goo awai wi’out
so much as anoother ward, you desarves to have no tongue in the
head of ’e.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“How easy it is to talk!” I replied, making ready to leave
her, and think by myself. “But how hard and impossible,
Tabby, to find any chance of doing anything. I must make up
my mind not to see her any more; but to think of her always,
as long as I live.”</p>

<p>“Boddledicks!” cried Mrs. Tapscott, her favourite interjection
of contempt—what it meant we knew not, and probably
not she. “Boddledicks, where be the brains of they men? I
could tull ’e what to do in half a zecond, lad, to vetch old
Coldpepper, and the young leddy too, and every mortial ’ooman
in thic there ouze, to hum eartr’e, the zame as if they zighted
’e a burning to the muckpit, with all their Zunday vainery
under thee arm.”</p>

<p>I looked at Tabby Tapscott with some surprise; for she
was giving greater force to her description by using leg and
arm as if she bore a share in all of it. And the vigour of her
countenance made me smile. But the old woman laughed
with a superior air. “Tak’th a bit o’ time, for volks with
slow brains to vollew my maind up—don’t her now? Goo up
to ’ouze, young man, and stale old Ragless.”</p>

<p>“Steal old Regulus!” I cried in great amazement, “why,
what good on earth would that do me? And if it would do any
good, how am I to manage it? I have not been brought up to
that profession.”</p>

<p>“I zeed a man to Barrinarbor, vaive and vorty year agone,
the most wonnerful cliver chap, I ever zee. He coom a-coortin’
of me, the taime as I wor ruckoned the purtiest maid in arl the
parish of Westdown. But I wadn’t have none of ’un, because
a’ wor so tricksy. Howsomever I didn’t zay ‘noo’ to wance,
for a’ wor the most wonnerful chap I ever zee. The Lord had
been and given he every zort o’ counsel. A’ could churm a
harse out of any vield or linhay, a’ could mak’ the coos hurn
to ’un, when the calves was zuckin’, a’ could vetch any dog
a’ took a vancy to from atwane his owner’s legs or from’s own
zupper. And a’ zhowed me a trick or two I han’t vorgotten
yet. I could tull ’e purty smart how to vetch old Ragless, and
kape ’un so long as you was mainded.”</p>

<p>Now I might have paid little attention to this, and indeed
had begun to reject the suggestion of a stratagem far below
the dignity of love, till suddenly a queer dream came to my
remembrance, a dream of last Sunday night, the very night
after that little adventure at the timber bridge. In that
enchanting vision, I had seen Miss Fairthorn smiling as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
came to me, through a lovely meadow enamelled with primrose,
and cowslip, and bluebell, herself of course the fairest of all the
flowers. And when I approached her, behold, she was led by
this same dog, old Regulus, who conducted her gracefully to
my longing arms, by means of the long gold chain which had
reposed on the stately bosom of Mrs. Jenny Marker. I am
not superstitious—as everybody vows when recounting his
dreams—but still it did seem strange.</p>

<p>“Lave it arl to me,” Mrs. Tapscott went on, as she saw my
hesitation. “Nort for ’e to do, but to gie me a zhillin’, vor to
buy the stuff, and nobody no wiser. Then goo avore zunrise,
and vetch old Ragless. Putt ’un in a barg, and keep ’un znug
in thic there old root-ouze. My stars and garters, what a bit
o’ vun ’twill be!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>A DOG VIOLATE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A great</span> observer of these latter days has advised us to abstain
from deep research into the origin of our own names. Otherwise
we might become convinced of a lamentable want of
lofty tone among those, without whom we could not have been
here, to show our superiority. A vein of fine thought is at
once set flowing; but for “Ragless” it would have flowed in
vain, as dogs have no surname to dwell upon.</p>

<p>His case was a strange one, and not without interest.
Nobody in our parish had any knowledge of his ancestry,
although he had won very high repute by biting many people
who got over it. Any other dog would have become the victim
of an injudicious outcry; but “Ragless,” by making some
other good bites, established his legal right to do it, and was
now considered a very wholesome dog, though he might have
a temper of his own. But even if he had, who was to blame?</p>

<p>Some seven, or it may have been eight years since, Miss
Coldpepper was “rolling in her carriage” down Feltham hill,
when the coachman pulled up very sharply, and just in time to
save mishap. All the boys in the village were let loose from
school, and with one accord had found a genial pastime, which
they were pursuing with the vigour of our race. They had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a poor dog, with no father, or mother, or even policeman to
defend him, and they had put him in a barrel near a garden-gate,
and tacked in the head so that no escape was left. This
being done to their entire satisfaction, what remained except to
roll him down the hill? And this they were doing with a
lofty sense of pleasure, and shouts that almost drowned the
smothered howls from within, when the carriage came upon
them, and very nearly served them right. “Let them have
the whip,” cried the lady with due feeling, when the footman
had jumped down and reported all the facts; but the ring-leaders
had vanished, and the boys who tasted lash were some
innocent little ones who had only helped in shouting. “Hand
him in to me,” was her next order; and the poor trembling
animal saw pity in her eyes, and gave her face a timid lick,
which made his fortune. No claimant being found for him,
the lady took him home, and aptly called him “Regulus,”
which the servants very promptly converted into “Ragless,”
reasoning well that the Italian greyhound wore a coat, but this
dog had none, save the bristles wherewith Nature had
endowed him. In the course of time he superseded every
other dog, and probably every human being, in the affection of
Miss Coldpepper.</p>

<p>If the early portion of his life had been unhappy, fortune
had now made him ample amends, and he should have been in
amity with all mankind. But whether from remembrance of
his youthful woes, or cynical perception of our frailties and
our frauds, Regulus never acquired that sweetness, which we
look for in dogs, so much more than in ourselves. His
standard of action was strict duty beyond doubt, but a duty
too strictly limited, and confined to two persons—himself,
and his mistress. With the rest of creation he was cheerfully
at war, though tolerably neutral towards the cook, when she
could bid high enough for his consideration. These things
made him deeply respected.</p>

<p>In person however, he was not quite a dog to arouse any
vast enthusiasm. He belonged to the order of the wiry-coated
terriers, if he was a terrier at all; for in him all the elements
were so duly mingled, that Nature could only proclaim him a
dog. The colour of ginger and that of cinnamon were blended
together in his outward dog; and he went on three legs, quite
as often as on four, as much from contempt of the earth
perhaps as from feelings of physical economy. There was
nothing base about him; he had fine teeth, and he showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
them, but never made insidious assault on anybody. When he
meant to bite, he did it quickly, and expressed his satisfaction
afterwards.</p>

<p>To seduce such a sentry, was an enterprise worthy of him,
who in sweet love’s service, and dispensing its mournful
melodies, enchanted the son of Echidna. And it may have
been this sense of difficulty, and a sporting desire to conquer it,
which led me to follow up the joke, and try my hand at a job,
which had beaten the deepest dog-stealers of Seven Dials.</p>

<p>All day long, I hoped to get at least a glimpse, or if bad luck
would not allow that, to hear at any rate something of that
young lady, without whom my life must grow old and barren.
For this was no school-boy affair of the fancy, nor even a light
skit of early manhood, such as fifty young fellows have out of
fifty-one, and go their way quickly after some other girl. I had
never been given to such fugitive sport; I was now in the
prime of my years almost, and though I might have looked at
maidens, and thought what pretty things they were, none had
ever touched my heart till now. And “touched” is by no
means the proper word to use; it should be said plainly, that
all my heart was occupied, and possessed to its deepest fibre by
a being far better, and sweeter, and nobler than its outer and
bodily owner; and that this must abide so to its very latest
pulse; as you will truly find, if you care to hear about it.</p>

<p>Not a word came to me about those things which destroyed
all my attention to any other; and the dusk had stopped work—which
was my only comfort—and I sat all alone that Wednesday
evening trying to get through a little bread and cheese,
but glancing more often from our old window at the gloomy
rush of the river, which was still in high flood though some
little abated. Uncle Corny was gone, to try to get some money
from people who had thriven on his hard-won fruit, and Mrs.
Tabby Tapscott had left the house early, upon some business of
her own. The house-door was open, for we had not many
rogues, till the railway came some years afterwards; and the
evening was of those that smell of beehives, and cornstacks,
and horses upon their way home. At last, when I had made
up my mind to be forgotten by every one, in came Tabby, as
bright as a bun.</p>

<p>“Oh fai, oh fai!” she cried; “whatever be ’e doing of?
Atin’ no zupper, and zittin’ as if ’e was mazed a’most. Look
’e zee what the Lord hath zent ’e! I was vorced to go arl the
way to Hampton for ’un, for year of they long tongues to Zunbury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
If this wun’t vetch Measter Ragless, arl I can zay is her
bain’t a dog. Putt ’un down in zellar, when I’ve larned ’e how
to use ’un.”</p>

<p>From beneath her shawl she produced a little box, which she
opened in triumph, and the room was filled at once with a very
peculiar odour quite unknown to me. It was pungent rather
than pleasant, and it made me sneeze as well as laugh.</p>

<p>“You be up there by vaive o’clock, when the daisies’ eyes be
openin’, and goo to the zide door I tould ’e of”—Mrs. Tapscott
knew all the household ways at Coldpepper Hall, through
a niece of hers who was kitchen-maid, “and vang this by the
coord out o’ heelin’, wi’out titchin’ of ’un with thy vingers, and
drag ’un athort the grass and the pilm to backzide o’ the zhrubbery,
and then you step out o’ zight in a lew cornder. Ould
dog be put out at zix o’clock riglar, and ’tis liable he’ll hurn
straight to ’e. Then let ’un ate a hummick, and kitch ’un up
vittily, and pop ’un into barg, and carr ’un home here, and I’ll
zhow ’e what to do with ’un. But mind as her don’t scammel
’e. Her be turble itemy.”</p>

<p>She gave me many other minute directions, and made me
laugh so that my spirits rose, with the hope of an interesting
little farce, to relieve the more tragic surroundings. I undertook
briskly to play my part, looking on the matter as a harmless
joke; though I came to think in course of time that the
cruel theft I suffered from might partly be a just requital for
this wicked robbery. And yet it was absurd and senseless, to
make such comparison.</p>

<p>Without disturbing Uncle Corny, who slept very heavily, I
was up before daylight on the Thursday morning, and set out
with the box and bag on my felonious enterprise. Coldpepper
Hall, or Manor, as it was called indifferently, stood back upon
some rising ground at a distance from the river, and was
sheltered well by growth of trees. There was nothing very
grand about it, and it leaned on stucco more than stone; but
there was plenty of room both within and without, and any one
getting inside the doors might say to himself, with some comfort
flowing into him—“I am sure that I need never be in any
hurry here.”</p>

<p>The sun meant to get up a little later on, when I jumped
the palings of this old demesne, at a place where of right there
should have been a footpath, but the owner of the Manor had
stopped it long ago, perceiving the superior claims of quietude.
Nobody had cared to make a fuss about it, but enough of ancestral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
right remained to justify me in getting over. Every
window of the house was still asleep, and I gazed at it with
humble reverence, not as the citadel of the Coldpeppers, but as
the shrine of my sacred love. Then I chose a place of ambush
in a nest of hollies, and approaching the sallyport of Regulus,
drew a slow trail from it across the dewy grass to my lurking-place,
and there waited calmly.</p>

<p>Sweet visions of love from the ivory gate now favoured me
with their attendance, partly perhaps because love had not
allowed me to sleep out my sleep. Far as I am from any claim
to the merits of a classical education, I had been for some years,
off and on, as a day boy at Hampton Grammar-school, and could
do a bit of Virgil pretty well, and an ode or two of Horace.
Whenever Uncle Corny came across a Latin name he would
call for me; and take it altogether, I had long been considered
the most learned young man in Sunbury. Even now I remembered,
though most of it was gone, the story of the Nymph who
placed her son in ambuscade for Proteus, and the noble description
of Regulus on parole, waving off the last kiss of his wife
and babes. Grimly he set his manly visage on the ground;
and my Regulus was doing the very same thing now.</p>

<p>Fat Charles had opened the door with a yawn, and sent
forth that animal of Roman type, to snuff the morning air, and
perform his toilet, and pay his orisons in general. Luxurious
days had told their tale; it was too plain that Capua had
corrupted Sabine simplicity. Regulus moved with a listless
air, his desire to find whom he might bite lay dormant, and no
sense of iniquity pricked his ears, or lifted the balance of his
tail. “Let the world wag,” was the expression of his eyes,
“I get whatever I want in it, and would wag to it also, if I
were not too fat.” It appeared too certain that if I meant to
catch him, I should have to go and bag him where he stood.</p>

<p>But suddenly down went his nose, and his bristles flew up,
and every line of his system grew stiff as wire. He had lit on
my trail near a narrow flower-border, and it presented itself
with a double aspect. Was it the ever-fresh memory of a cat—not
a cat of every-day life of course, but a civet-cat, a musk-cat,
a cat of poetic, or even fabulous perfume? Or was it the
long-drawn sweetness of a new ambrosial food, heaven-sent to
tempt his once lively, but now vainly wept-for appetite?
Whatever it might be, the line of duty was marked, and
beyond evasion.</p>

<p>Those of our race who have made a study of dogs, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
sake of example, declare that the best and most noble of them
follow quest with their noses well up in the air. Regulus
failed in this test of merit; he spread his nostrils affably
within an inch of where the worms lay, pricked his hairy ears,
which were of divers colours, and with the stump of his tail
as the loftiest point of his person, ran a bee-line towards me.
In accordance with his fame, I made ready for a bite; but to
my surprise he paused, when he came point-blank upon me,
and seemed taken aback, as with some wholly new emotion.
Regardful of the teaching of my Nymph, I offered him a
portion of the magic sop, and while he was intent upon it
slipped a stout potato-sack over his head, tumbled him in with
a push in the rear, and shouldered him.</p>

<p>Taking the path across the fields, I got home without meeting
any one, and found Tabby waiting for me near the root-house,
which was simply the trunk of a grand old oak, with a
slab of elm fitted as a door to it. No one was likely to visit
this old storehouse at the present time of year, and the loudest
wailing of the largest dog might be carried on in the strictest
privacy. But I meant him to be happy there, and so he was—to
some extent.</p>

<p>For he seemed to resign himself, as if recalling his early
adventure in the barrel, and regarded his later prosperity as a
dream; and probably the charm of the drug he had swallowed
acted benignly upon his nerves. At any rate he allowed himself
to be secured by a chain and a fold-pitcher, and even
licked my hand instead of snarling and showing his teeth.
Every arrangement was made for his comfort, and he lay down
as happy as a lotus-eater.</p>

<p>After breakfast, I took a little turn in the village, and there
had the pleasure of seeing fat Charles, the Coldpepper footman,
nearly trying to run, and looking sadly out of breath. He
carried a leading strap, with no dog to it, and under his arm
was a bundle of papers. As I approached him with kind
inquiries, he drew forth his roll and requested me to read,
while he was recovering his breath a little. My face must
have turned as red as his—for this was the first theft I ever
committed, except of some apples from a rival grower, a curmudgeon
who would not tell us what they were—and I felt
very queer as I read the following, written in round hand and
with many capitals.</p>

<p>“Reward of one guinea!—Lost, stolen, or strayed, a large
brindled terrier, known as ‘Regulus,’ the property of Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Coldpepper of Coldpepper Manor. He is very hard of hearing,
and a little fond of snapping. Any person bringing him home
will receive the above reward, and no questions asked. Any
one detaining him will be prosecuted, with the utmost rigour
of the law.”</p>

<p>Charles had a score perhaps of these placards, written in
sundry hands, and spelt in divers manners, as if all the household
had been set to work.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Kit,” he cried, for every one called me that;
“there is the devil to pay, up to the ’All, and no mistake! And
all of it blamed on me, as innocent as the babe unborn, and
more so, for only obeying of my horders. What did I do, but
just turn the brute out—for a brute he is and no mistake, though
wholesome in his bite, because it is his nature to; and no one
round these parts would be tough enough in the legs to come
forrard with a view of making off with him—then I shut the
door to, for his quarter hour airing, as laid down in written
horders issued every night. And my hair stood on end when
he never come back, the same as his does, when he flies at you.”</p>

<p>“But surely, Charles, some of you must have some suspicion?”
I asked, with astonishment at my own vice, and wondering
what I should come to, though not far enough gone as yet to
look at him; “why should the dog go from such a good home?”</p>

<p>“Because he’ve had enough of it, or we of him at any rate.
He ain’t been stolen, sir; the dog have that knowledge of the
world, that all Seven Dials couldn’t lay a tack to him. And
everybody knows what our Missus is. A guinea! Who’d steal
a dog for a guinea? Let alone a dog who’ll make a pepper-caster
of you. No, no, I always said Old Nick would come for
’un, some blessed morning; and I’m jiggered if he haven’t!
But bless my soul, you mustn’t keep me loitering like this, sir.
Mother Cutthumb wouldn’t have one, to stick up in her dirty
old window, Lord knows why. Do’e take one, and stick on
your Uncle’s wall; or a couple if you will, that’s a dear young
man. There’ll be thirty more ready, by eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>It occurred to me that some of them perhaps had been
written by a certain lovely warm hand, which had the most
delicious way with it that could ever be imagined of stealing
in and out of muff or glove, and of coming near another hand
(as coarse as a crumpet) in a sort of way that seemed to
say—“Now wouldn’t you like to touch me?”</p>

<p>“Who on earth can have written all these?” I asked.
“Mr. Charles, why you must have done most of them yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never a blessed one; Lord save you, I’ve a’ been on my
poor legs, all the morning! Every maid that could fist a few
was ordered in. But the young leddy fisted them four at the
bottom.”</p>

<p>Making due allowance for his miscreant coarseness, I slipped
away the lowest four, and two others; those two I stuck up on
the outer face of Uncle Corny’s red-brick wall; but the other
four never were exhibited to the public, nor even to myself,
except as a very private view. And every one of them belongs
to me at the present moment. The footman thanked me warmly
for this lightening of his task, and hurried on towards Rasp the
baker, and the linendraper.</p>

<p>So far as my memory serves, Uncle Corny got very little
work out of me that day. I was up and down the village, till
my conscience told me that my behaviour might appear suspicious;
and I even beheld the great lady herself, driving
as fast as her fat steeds could travel, to get her placards
displayed all around in the villages towards London. Although
she was not very popular, and the public seemed well pleased
with her distress, I felt more than half inclined to take her
dear love back, and release him at his own door after dark.
But Tabby Tapscott said, and she had a right to speak,—“Don’t
’e be a vule now, Measter Kit. Carr’ the job droo,
wanst ’a be about ’un.” And just before dark I met Mrs. Marker,
and somebody with her, who made my heart jump. They had
clearly been sent as a forlorn hope, to go the round of the
shops where the bills had been posted. I contrived to ask
tenderly whether the dog was found.</p>

<p>“Not he, and never will be,” replied the housekeeper.
“There are so many people who owe the cur a grudge. Why,
he even flies at me, if I dare to look at him. Miss Kitty, tell
Mr. Kit what your opinion is.”</p>

<p>“I fear indeed that somebody must have shot him with an
air-gun. I am very fond of dogs, when they are at all good
dogs; but very few could praise poor Regulus, except—except
as we praise mustard. And I heard of a case very like it in
London.”</p>

<p>Her voice was so silvery sweet, and she dropped it (as I
thought) so sadly at that last word, that I could not help saying,
although I was frightened at my own tone while I said
it,—</p>

<p>“Surely you are not going back to-morrow? Do say that
you are not going to leave us all to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Before she could answer, the housekeeper said sharply—“She
was to have gone to-morrow, Mr. Orchardson. But
now Miss Coldpepper has made up her mind to send for Captain
Fairthorn the first thing to-morrow, unless she recovers the dog
meanwhile. Not that he knows anything about dogs, but
he is so scientific that he is sure to find out something. Good
night, sir! Come, Kitty, how late we are!”</p>

<p>Is it needful to say that Regulus indued a tunic of oak that
night?</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>AN UPWARD STROKE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> character of Captain Fairthorn—better known to the
public now as Sir Humphrey Fairthorn, but he had not as yet
conferred dignity upon Knighthood—will be understood easily
by those who have the knowledge to understand it. But neither
Uncle Corny, nor myself—although we were getting very clever
now at Sunbury—could manage at all to make him out at first,
though it must have been a great deal easier then, than when
we came to dwell upon him afterwards. All that he said was
so perfectly simple, and yet he was thinking of something else
all the time; and everything he did was done as if he let someone
else do it for him. I cannot make any one understand him,
for the plainest of all plain reasons—I could never be sure that
I myself understood him. And this was not at all because he
meant to be a mystery to any one; for that was the last thing
he would desire, or even believe himself able to be. The reason
that kept him outside of our reason—so far as I can comprehend
it—was that he looked at no one of the many things to be
feared, to be desired, to be praised, or blamed, from the point of
view we were accustomed to.</p>

<p>I had thought that my Uncle Cornelius (though he was
sharp enough always, and sometimes too sharp, upon me and my
doings) was upon the whole the most deliberate and easy-going
of mortals; but a mere glance at Professor Fairthorn showed
how vastly the breadth of mankind was beyond me. To look
at his face, without thinking about him, was enough to compose
any ordinary mind, and charm away any trivial worries; but to
listen to his voice, and observe him well, and meet his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
eyes thoughtfully, and to catch the tranquility of his smile, this
was sufficient to make one ashamed of paltry self-seeking and
trumpery cares, and to lead one for the moment into larger
ways. And yet he was not a man of lofty visions, poetic
enthusiasm, or ardent faith in the grandeur of humanity. I
never heard him utter one eloquent sentence, and I never saw
him flush with any fervour of high purpose. He simply seemed
to do his work, because it was his nature, and to have no more
perception of his influence over others, than they had of the
reason why he owned it. So far as we could judge, he was
never thinking of himself; and that alone was quite enough to
make him an enigma.</p>

<p>Now people may suppose, and very naturally too, that my
warm admiration of the daughter impelled me to take an over-lofty
view of the father. People would be quite wrong, however,
for in that view I was not alone; every one concurred,
and even carried it still further; and certainly there was no
personal resemblance to set me on that special track. Professor—or
as I shall call him henceforth, because he preferred it, Captain
Fairthorn—was not of any striking comeliness. His face
was very broad, and his mouth too large, and his nose might be
said almost to want re-blocking, and other faults might have
been found by folk who desire to talk picturesquely. But even
the hardest of mankind to please (in everything but self-examination)
would have found no need, and small opportunity,
for improvement in his eyes and forehead. I know my own
stupidity, or at least attempt to do so, when it is not altogether
too big; yet I dare to deny that it had anything to do with the
charm I fell under in this man’s presence. And this is more
than proved by the fact that Uncle Corny—as dry an old Grower
as was ever frozen out—could resist the large quietude of our
visitor, even less than I could.</p>

<p>For the Captain had been sent for, sure enough, about a
little business so far below his thoughts. And when he came
into our garden, to thank us for all we had done towards
discovery of the thief, and especially to thank me for my
valiant services to his daughter, it is no exaggeration at all to
say that I wished the earth would hide me from his great grey
eyes. Under their kindly and yet distant gaze, I felt what a
wretched little trickster I had been; and if he had looked at
me for another moment, I must have told him everything, for
the sake of his forgiveness. But he, unhappily for himself, if
he could be unhappy about little things, measured his fellow-men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
by his own nature, and suspected nothing until it had
been proved. And at that very moment, he caught sight of
something, which absorbed him in a scientific zeal we could
not follow.</p>

<p>“A young tree dead!” he exclaimed; “and with all its
foliage hanging! Three other young trees round it injured on
the sides towards it. When did you observe this? Had you
that storm on Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it did rain cats and dogs,” my Uncle answered
after thinking. “We said that it might break the long bad
weather; and it seems to have done it at last, thank the Lord.
There was a lot of lightning, but not so very nigh.”</p>

<p>“Then no trees were struck from above, not even that old
oak, which seems to have been struck some years ago? May
I cross the border, and examine that young tree? Thank
you; have you ever known a case like this before?”</p>

<p>They passed very dangerously near the old oak; and I
trembled, as that villain of a Regulus showed his base want
of gratitude by a long howl; but luckily neither of them
heard it. I went to the door, and threatened him with instant
death, and then followed to hear the discussion about the tree.
“You have known it before,” Captain Fairthorn was saying;
“but not for some years, and if you remember right, not when
the storms were particularly near. I have heard of several
similar cases, but never had the fortune to see one till now.
You perceive that the life is entirely gone. The leaves are
quite black, but have a narrow yellow margin. Forgive me
for troubling you, Mr. Orchardson, but when did you notice
this condition of the tree?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it kept on raining up till dark on Saturday;
and I did not chance to come by here on Sunday. But on
Monday morning it was as you see it now—gone off all of a
heap, and no cause for it. As healthy a young tree as you
would wish to look at—a kind of pear we call Beurré Diel.
Dead as a door-nail, you can see. Kit, get a spade, and dig
it up for Professor.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, not yet. I was going home to-night, but
this is a matter I must examine carefully. That is to say,
with your kind permission. We use big words, Mr. Orchardson,
that sound very learned; and we write very positively
from other people’s observation. But one case, that we have
seen with our own eyes, and searched into on the spot to
the utmost of our power, is worth fifty we have only read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of. You will think me very troublesome, I greatly fear;
and of gardening matters I know less than nothing. But you
will oblige me more than I can say, if you will let me come
again, and try to learn some little. You know what has
killed this tree, I presume.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I have not got any sense at all about it,” my
Uncle answered stoutly; “’Tis the will of the Lord, when a
tree goes off; or if it is the doing of any chap of mine, he goes
off too, and there’s an end of it. Something amiss with these
roots, I take it.”</p>

<p>His boots were tipped with heavy iron, and he was starting
for a good kick at the dead young tree, when I ran between,
and said, “Uncle, let it stay just as it is, for a day or two.
It can’t draw anything out of the ground; and this gentleman
would like to examine it, as it is.”</p>

<p>“Young gentleman, that is the very point.” Captain Fairthorn,
as he spoke, looked kindly at me; “if I could be permitted
to have my own way, I would have a little straw shaken round
it to-night, as lightly as may be, without any foot coming
nearer than can be helped to it. That will keep the surface as
it is, from heavy rain, or any other accident. Then if I may
be indulged in my crotchets, I would bring my daughter, who
draws correctly, to make a careful sketch and colour it. And
after that is done, and I have used my treble lens at every
point of divergence, I would ask as a very great favour to be
allowed to open the ground myself, and trace the roots from
their terminal fibres upwards. I would not dare to ask all
this for my own sake, Mr. Orchardson; but because we may
learn something from it of a thing as yet little understood—what
is called the terrestrial discharge. We get more and
more into big words, you see. You have known trees
destroyed in this way before. It only happens on certain
strata.”</p>

<p>“It has happened here, sir, for generations,” said my Uncle,
trying hard to look scientific. “The thunderstorm blight is
what we call it. We call anything a blight, when the meaning
is beyond us. Seems as if some trees was subject to it.
I never knew an apple-tree took this way. But pear-trees
have been so, times out of mind, though never none but the
younger ones. A few years agone, I can’t say how many,
seventeen young pear-trees were killed outright, ten in one
part of the grounds, and seven in another, and not a mark to
be found on one of them. All as dead as door-nails when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
come to look at them. A blight, or a blast, that’s what we
call it. And there’s nothing to do but to plant another.”</p>

<p>“A truly British view of the question,” Captain Fairthorn
answered with his sweet smile, which threw me into a glow
by its likeness to a smile yet lovelier; “I wish I could tell
you how I feel for the English fruit-grower in his hard struggle
with the climate, the dealers, and the foreign competition. It
is a hard fight always, much worse than the farmers; and a
season like this is like knocking a drowning man on the head.
And yet you are so brave that you never complain!”</p>

<p>The truth of these words, and the tone of good will, made
a deep impression upon both of us, especially upon my Uncle,
who had to find the money for everything.</p>

<p>“No, sir, we never complain,” he replied; “we stand up
to the seasons like our own trees, and we keep on hoping for
a better time next year. But there are very few that know
our difficulties, and folk that can scarcely tell a pear from an
apple go about the country, spouting and writing by the yard,
concerning of our ignorance. Let them try it, is all I say,
let them try it, if they are fools enough. Why bless my heart,
there’s a fellow preaching now about sorting of apples, as if we
had not done it before he sucked his coral! But I won’t go
on maundering—time will show. Glad to see you, sir, at any
time, and if I should happen to be about the grounds, my
nephew Kit will see to everything you want. What time
shall we see you to-morrow, sir?”</p>

<p>We were walking to the gate by this time, and Captain
Fairthorn pulled out his watch. I observed that he had a true
sailor’s walk, and a sailor’s manner of gazing round, and the
swing of his arms was nautical.</p>

<p>“What a time I have kept you!” he exclaimed with
simple wonder; “and I have forgotten altogether my proper
business. I was to have tried some special means, for recovering
the dog we were speaking of. Unless he is heard of to-night,
I shall have little time to spare to-morrow. I am bound
to do all I can for my good hostess. But to think that a dog,
and a dog of no benevolence—according to my daughter—should
stand in the way of this most interesting matter!
However, I will do my best all the morning, and try to be
with you by eleven o’clock. If I cannot come then, you will
know what the cause is. But even for the best of dogs, I
must not drop the subject. Now I thank you most heartily.
Good-night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a wonderful man!” was my Uncle’s reflection;
“to know all about trees, and thunderstorms, and dogs, and Covent
Garden! And yet to let a woman twist him round her thumb,
and tread on his child, and turn his pockets inside out!
Come along, Kit, I am pretty nigh starved.”</p>

<p>And this wonderful man added yet another crown to his
glory that very same night, as I heard. For to him, and his
wisdom, was set down the credit of a joyful and extraordinary
event.</p>

<p>A young man, slouching with a guilty conscience and a
bag on his back, might have been seen—if his bad luck had
prevailed—approaching a fine old mansion craftily, when the
shadows stole over the moon, if there was one. Then an
accurate observer might have noticed a quadruped of somewhat
downcast mien issuing with much hesitation from a sack, and
apparently reluctant to quit his guardian, who had evidently
won his faithful heart. But receiving stern orders to make
himself scarce, he might next be seen gliding to a gloomy
door, uplifting wistfully one ancient paw scraping at the
paint where it had been scraped before, and then throwing
his head back, and venting his long-pent emotions in a howl
of inexpressible sadness. The door was opened, the guardian
vanished with suspicious promptitude, lights were seen glancing
in a long range of windows, an outbreak of feminine
voices moved the air, and after a shrill and unnatural laugh,
came a sound as of hugging, and a cry of—“Run, for your
life, for his liver, Jane!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>THE FINE ARTS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the butter that truly is butterine, and the “Cheddar”
of the Great Republic, are gracefully returned to our beloved
grocer, with a feeble prayer for amendment, what does he say?
Why, the very same thing that he said upon the last occasion—“Indeed!
all our customers like it extremely; it is the very
thing we have had most praise for; and this is the very first
complaint.”</p>

<p>In like manner I received for answer (when I fain would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
have sent back to that storekeeper Love a few of the sensations
I had to pay for) that everybody praised them, and considered
them ennobling, and was only eager once again to revel in their
freshness. And to tell the truth, when my own time came for
looking calmly back at them, I became one of the larger public,
and would have bought them back at any price, as an old
man regards his first caning.</p>

<p>However I did not know that now, and could not stop to
analyze my own feelings, which might for the moment perhaps
be described as deep longings for a height never heard of. All
the every-day cares, and hide-bound pothers of the people round
me, were as paltry pebbles below my feet; and I longed to be
alone, to think of one other presence, and only one.</p>

<p>Uncle Corny, in his downright fashion, called me as mad as
a March hare; but I was simply sorry for him, and kept out
of his way, and tried to work. Tabby Tapscott became a
plague, by poking common jokes at me; and the family men
on the premises seemed to have a grin among themselves, when
my back was turned. The only man I could bear to work
with, was the long one we called “Selsey Bill,” because he came
from that part of Sussex, and resembled that endless projection.
He was said to have seventeen lawful children—enough
to keep any man silent. Moreover he was beyond all doubt
the ugliest man in the parish; which may have added to my
comfort in his mute society, as a proof of the facility of wedlock.
The sharp click of his iron heel on the treddle of his
spade, the gentle sigh that came sometimes, as he thought of
how little he would find for supper, and the slow turn of his
distorted eyes as he looked about for the wheelbarrow—all
these by some deep law of nature soothed my dreamy discontent.</p>

<p>But what was there fairly to grumble at? If I chose to cast
my eyes above me, and set my affections out of reach, reason
could not be expected to undo unreason. And hitherto, what
luck had led me, what good fortune fed me with the snatches
of warm rapture! Even my own wickedness had prospered, and
never been found out. Surely the fates were on my side, and
the powers of the air encouraged me.</p>

<p>What a lovely morning it was now, for the fairest of beings
to walk abroad, and for me to be walking in the same direction!
Although the earth was sodden still, and the trees unripe with
summer drip, and the autumnal roses hung their sprays with
leathery balls, instead of bloom; yet the air was fresh, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sky bright blue, and the grass as green as in the May month;
and many a plant, that is spent and withered after a brilliant
season, was opening its raiment to tempt the sun, and budding
into gems for him to polish. The spring, that had forgotten
tryst with earth this year, and been weeping for it ever since,
was come at last, if only for one tender glance through the russet
locks of autumn. Why should not man, who suffers with
the distresses of the air and earth, take heart again, and be
cheerful with them; ay, and enjoy his best condition—that of
loving, and being loved?</p>

<p>There was enough to tempt the gloomiest, and most timid
mortal, to make his venture towards such bliss, when Kitty
Fairthorn, blushing softly, and glancing as brightly as the sunshine
twinkles through a bower of wild rose, came along to me
alone, where I stood looking out for her father. Although I
had been thinking bravely all the things set down above, not
one of them kept faith, or helped me to the courage of their
reasoning. Instead of that, my heart fell low, and my eyes
(which had been full of hope) would scarcely dare to render to
it the picture of which it held so many, yet never could manage
to hold enough. She saw my plight, and was sorry for it, and
frightened perhaps both of that and herself.</p>

<p>“It is so unlucky,” she said, without looking any more
than good manners demanded at me; “last night I began to
think that all was going to be quite nice again; for that very
peculiar dog, that my aunt is so strongly attached to, just
came back; as if he had only gone for a little airing on his own
account, and so as to have all the road to himself. He was as
fat as ever, but oh so gentle! And his reputation is not quite
that. Perhaps you have heard of him. He seems to be well
known.”</p>

<p>“I think I have heard of him. Why, of course it must be
the dog that was mentioned in the hand-bills! We had two of
them upon our wall. Mrs. Marker was speaking of him, when
you passed on Thursday, only I could not attend to <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then you ought to have done so,” she replied, as if without
any idea of my inner thought; “for there has been the
greatest excitement about it. But I suppose, inside these walls,
and among these trees and lovely flowers, you scarcely know
what excitement is.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I, then? Oh, I wish I didn’t!” I replied with a
deeply sad look at her; “it is you, who are so much above all
this, who can have no idea what real—real—a sort of despair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
I mean, is like. But I beg your pardon; you mustn’t notice
me.”</p>

<p>“How can I help being sorry for you?” she asked very
softly, when our eyes had met. “You have been so good to
me, and saved my life. But of course I have no right to ask
what it is. And I know that the crops are always failing.
And now you have a dear little tree quite dead. My father has
sent me, to try to make a careful drawing of it, because it was
struck by some extraordinary lightning. And the worst of it
is, that he has been called away, and can hardly be back till
the evening. He has invented a new conductor, for ships of
the Navy, that are to have iron all over and under them, and
therefore want protecting. He had a letter from the Admiralty
this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, what a pity! What a sad loss!” I replied.
“I am afraid it will take us so much longer, without having
him here to direct us. And I doubt if my Uncle Cornelius will
be able to be with us, half the time.”</p>

<p>“Oh that is just what I was to say!” her tone was demure,
but her glance quite bright; “on no account am I to interfere
with the valuable time of Mr. Orchardson. Indeed I shall not
trouble any one. If I may only be shown the poor tree, and then
be allowed to fetch a chair, or a stool, or even a hassock, and then
be told where to find some clear water, and perhaps be reminded
when the time is one o’clock, I am sure I shall do beautifully.”</p>

<p>“You are certain to do beautifully; there is no other way
that you could do. No one shall be allowed to disturb you; I
should like to see any one dare to come near you except—except—”</p>

<p>“Except Mrs. Tapscott. You see I have heard of her.
And it is so kind of you to think of her. Then I shall be quite
happy.”</p>

<p>“Mrs Tapscott indeed! No, except me myself. I shall
lock that chattering woman in the back kitchen, or how could
you ever do a stroke? I am sure it will take you a very long
time. There are three other trees that you ought to draw, if
you wish to show exactly what the lightning did. I hardly see
how you can finish to-day. If you leave off at one o’clock, it
will be utterly impossible. And my Uncle Cornelius will be
in such a rage, if you think of going back without anything
to eat.”</p>

<p>“How very kind everybody is down here! It is the very
nicest place I ever have been in. It will be so miserable to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
away. I am not at all accustomed to such kindness.” Her lovely
eyes glistened as she began to speak, and a tear was in each of
them as she turned away. I felt as if I could have cried myself,
to see such an innocent angel so sad. But I durst not ask any
questions, and was bound to go on as if I knew nothing.</p>

<p>“What a little drawing-block you have!” I said; “you
ought to have one at least twice that size. Do let me lend you
one. I have three or four; and you can choose which you like
of them. And my pencils too, and my colour-box. There are
none to be had in the village. If you will rest a moment in
this little harbour, I will get them all, and a chair for
you.”</p>

<p>It did not take me long to let Tabby Tapscott know, that if
she dared even to look out of the window, she would mourn for
it all the rest of her life; moreover that she must not let anybody
know in what direction I was gone, even if his Grace of
C. G. himself came down, to grant us the best stall he had for
ever. Tabby winked with both eyes, and inquired if I took her
for a “vule, or a zany, or a coochey hosebird,” and said she
would have “zummut good for nummatin,” by one o’clock.
And as I hurried back to the bower, there came almost into my
very hand the loveliest <i>Souvenir d’un Ami</i> rose that ever lifted
glossy pink, to show the richer glow within. This rose I cut
with the tender touch which a gardener uses boldly, and laid it
on my drawing-block, so that each exquisite tinge and fringe
and curve of radiant leaflet, as well as the swanlike bend of
stalk and soft retirement of sepal, led up to the crowning
beauty of the bloom above them.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything to equal that,” said one who might
outvie the whole; “who can have taught you, Mr. Kit, such
knowledge of what is beautiful?”</p>

<p>She had called me by my village-name; and more than that,
she had let me know that she looked upon me as a rustic. I
saw my advantage, and was deeply hurt, that she might make
it up again.</p>

<p>“You are right,” I answered, turning back, as if in sad
abasement; “Miss Fairthorn, you are right indeed in supposing
that I know nothing. However, I am able to carry a chair,
and to wait upon you humbly. Let us go to the tree; and at
one o’clock, I will venture to come, and tell the time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I never meant it at all like that! I could never have
imagined you would take me up so. I seem to say the wrong
thing always, as I am told every day at home. I hoped that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
was not true; but now—now, I have given offence to you, you,
who have been so good to me. I could never attempt to draw
to-day. I will tell my father that I was rude to you, and he
will send somebody else to do it.” I felt that this would have
served me right; but I was not in love with justice.</p>

<p>“I implore you not to do that,” I said; “really that would
be too hard upon me. Why should you wish to be hard upon
me? I am trying to think what I have done to deserve it.
You are worse than the ground lightning.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I killed your trees. I am not going now
to be silly any more. Tell me what to do, to show that you
have quite forgiven me. You know that I never meant to vex
you.” She looked at me so sweetly, that I could only meet her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I declare it will be one o’clock, before I have done a thing.
What will my father say? And I must be so careful. I am
sure that you could do it better, better much than I can. Will
you do it, while I go and look for Mr. Orchardson? I like him
very much, and his fruit is so delicious. No, you won’t relieve
me? Well, shake hands, and be good friends again. May I
have this lovely rose, to give my father something beautiful,
when he comes back from London?”</p>

<p>I saw that she was talking fast, that my prudence might
come back to me. She knew as well from my long gaze, that I
loved her, and must always love her, as I to the bottom of my
heart knew it. And she did not seem offended at me, only
blushed, and trembled, just as if some important news were
come (perhaps by telegraph), and she wondered while she
opened it.</p>

<p>For me this was enough, and more almost than I could hope
for—to let her keep this knowledge in her mind, and dwell
upon it; until if happy angels came—as they gladly would—to
visit her, the sweetest of them all might fan it, with his wings,
into her heart.</p>

<p>“Halloa, Kit my lad!” cried Uncle Corny, when he came
to dinner, and my darling was gone with her sketch half done,
and I had only dared to hover near her. “Sweetheart been
here, they tell me. What a leary chap you are! When I
heard Cap’en was gone to Town, I thought it was all over. I’ve
been wanting you up at packing-shed, for the last three hours.
No more good work left in you. That’s what come of sweet
hearting.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Corny, if you must be vulgar, because you have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
proper sense of things, the least you can do is not to holloa, as
if you were driving a truck of rags and bones.”</p>

<p>“Hoity, toity! Here’s a go! One would think there had
been no courting done, since Adam and Eve, till your time.
Too hot to hold—that’s my opinion. And as for rags and bones,
young fellow, that’s just about what it will come to. The girl
won’t have sixpence, by what I hear; though there’s lots of tin
in the family. I know a deal more than you do about them.
Don’t pop the question without my leave.”</p>

<p>What a way to put it!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>AN EMPTY PILE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> no token had passed between us, and no currency
been set up, of that universal interchange, which my Uncle and
Tabby termed “courting,” I felt a very large hope now, that
the goods I had to offer,—quiet as they were, and solid, without
any spangle—were on their way to be considered, and might be
regarded kindly. For while I knew how poor I was, in all the
more graceful attributes, and little gifted with showy powers of
discourse, or the great world’s glitter, void moreover of that
noble cash which covers every other fault, yet my self-respect
and manhood told me that I was above contempt. Haughty
maidens might, according to their lights, look down on me; let
them do so, it would never hurt me; I desired no haughtiness.
That which had taken my heart, and led it, with no loss to its
own value, was sweetness, gentleness, loving-kindness, tender
sense of woman’s nature, and the joy of finding strength in man.
For though I am not the one to say it, I knew that I was no
weakling, either in body, or in mind. Slow of wit I had
always been, and capable only of enjoying the greater gifts of
others; but as I plodded on through life, I found it more and
more the truth, that this is the better part to have. I enjoy
my laugh tenfold, because it is a thing I could never have made
for myself.</p>

<p>But for a long time yet to come, there was not much
laughter before me. One of the many griefs of love is, that it
stops the pores of humour, and keeps a man clogged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
earnestness. At the same time, he becomes the Guy, and butt
for all the old jokes that can be discharged by clumsy fellows
below contempt. None of these hit him, to any good purpose,
because he is ever so far above them; but even the smell of
their powder is nasty, as a whiff across his incense.</p>

<p>For eight and forty hours, it was my good fortune to believe
myself happy, and thereby to be so; though I went to church
twice on Sunday, without seeing any one except the parson,
who was very pleasant. But suddenly on Monday a few words
were uttered; and I became no better than a groan.</p>

<p>“Her be gan’,” were the words of Mrs. Tapscott.</p>

<p>“Tabby, what the Devil do you mean?” I asked, though not
at all accustomed to strong language.</p>

<p>“I tull ’e, her be gan’. Thee never zee her no more. Step-moother
’a been down, and vetched her.” Tabby herself looked
fit to cry; although there was a vile kind of triumph in her eyes,
because she had prophesied it.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me,” I asked slowly, and as if I were
preparing to destroy her, “that Miss Fairthorn has been taken
away, without even saying ‘Good-bye’ to me?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tull nort about no Good-bais. Her maight ’a left
’un for ’e. Her be gan to Lunnon town, and no mistake.
Zeed the girt coach myzell, and the maid a-crying in her.”</p>

<p>Without thinking properly what I was about, I clapped on
a hat, and laid hold of a big stick, and set forth upon the
London road; not the Hampton road which runs along the
river, but the upper road from Halliford, which takes a shorter
course through Twickenham. Tabby ran after me, shouting—“Be
’e mazed? If ’e could vlai, ’e could never overget her.
Be gan’ dree hour, or more, I tull ’e.”</p>

<p>But in spite of that fearful news, I strode on. And I
might have gone steadily on till I got to London—for there
was the track of the wheels quite plain, the wheels of Miss
Coldpepper’s heavy carriage—if I had not met our “Selsey
Bill,” the Bill Tompkins whom I may have mentioned. My
Uncle had sent him to Twickenham, I think, to see about some
bushel-baskets; and he was swinging home with a dozen on his
head, which made his columnar height some fifteen feet; for he
was six and three quarters, without his hat.</p>

<p>In reply to my fervid inquiries, he proceeded, in a most
leisurely yet impressive manner, to explain that he had not met
the carriage, because it had passed him on his way to Twickenham,
and might be expected back by now; as Miss Coldpepper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
never allowed her horses to go beyond Notting-Hill Gate,
whence her guests must go on other wheels into London. I
took half of his baskets (for he was too long to be strong) and
so returned to my uncle’s gate with half a dozen “empties”
on my head, and a heart more empty than the whole of them.</p>

<p>This was almost a trifle compared to the grief that befell me
later on—which has left its mark on me till I die—for though
cast down terribly, I was not crushed, and no miserable doubts
came to rend me in twain. Though my darling was gone, I
could tell where she was, or at any rate could find out in a day
or two. And it was clear that she had been carried off against
her will; otherwise how could our Tabby see her crying? It
is a shameful and cruel thing, and of the lowest depths of selfishness,
to rejoice at the tears of an angel; and I did my very
utmost to melt into softest sympathy. To be certain of the
need for this, I examined Mrs. Tapscott most carefully as to the
evidence.</p>

<p>“I zeed ’un wi’ my own heyesight; girt big drops,” she
said, “the zize of any hazzlenits. Rackon, thee mouth be
wattering, Master Kit, vor to kiss ’un awai.”</p>

<p>This may have been true, but was not at all the proper way
to express it. The only thing wrong on my part was, that a
lively thrill of selfish hope ran down the veins of sympathy.
She wept—she wept! Why should she weep, except at having
left behind her some one whom she would most sadly miss?
Could it be Miss Coldpepper? Happily that was most unlikely,
from the lady’s character. Mrs. Marker? No, I think not—a
very decent sort of woman, but not at all absorbing. Uncle
Corny? Out of the question. A highly excellent and upright
man; but a hero of nails, and shreds, and hammers, and green-baize
aprons, and gooseberry knives. Ah, but Uncle Corny
has a nephew—</p>

<p>“Kit, I am sorry for you, my boy;” he came up to me, as I
was thinking thus, even before he went to his tobacco-jar; “you
are hard hit, my lad; I can see it in your face; and you shall
have no more chaff from me. Very few girls, such as they are
now, deserve that any straight and honest young chap, like you,
should be down in the mouth about them. But your mother
did, Kit, your mother did. And I am not sure but that this
Miss Fairthorn does; though you can’t judge a girl by her
bonnet. But I am not going to be overcobbed like this. If
you have set your heart upon the girl, and she on you,—so be
it, Amen! You shall be joined together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>My Uncle came up, as he spoke, and looked with friendly
intentions at me, and yet with a medical gaze and poise, which
inclined me to be indignant. “It takes two parties to make an
agreement,” I said, neither gratefully nor graciously.</p>

<p>“S’pose I don’t know that, after all the robberies taken out
of me? But I know what I say, and I tell you, that if your
mind is set upon this matter, you shall have it your own way.
Only first of all, be sure that you know your mind. Few people
do, in this ‘age of invention’—as they call it, without inventing
much, except lies—if you are sure that you know your
mind, speak out, and have done with it.”</p>

<p>I stood up and looked at him, without a word. All my
gratitude for his good-will was lost in my wrath at his doubt of
my steadfastness.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, “you need not stare, as if you were
thunder and lightning. When you think about it, you will see
that I was right; for this is no easy business, Kit, and not to be
gone into, like a toss for sixpence. I have spoiled you, ever
since you were a child; because you had no father, and no
mother. You have had your own way wonderfully; and that
makes it difficult for you to know your mind.”</p>

<p>If that were the only obstacle, I ought to have the finest
knowledge of my mind; for the times had been very far
asunder, when I had been allowed to follow my own way. But
I knew that Uncle Corny took the other view, and he had this
to bear him out, that he always managed that my way should be
his way. It was not the time to argue out that question now;
and one of my ways most sternly barred was that of going
counter to him in opinion. So I only muttered that he had
been very good to me.</p>

<p>“I have,” he continued; “and you are bound to feel it.
Five shillings a week you have been receiving, ever since you
could be trusted to lay in a tree; as well as your board and
lodging, and your boots, and all except tailoring. Very well,
if you set up a wife, you will look back with sorrow on these
days of affluence. But to warn you is waste of words, in your
present frame. Only I wish you to hear both sides. I have
no time now; but if you like to come to me, when I have done
up my books, I will tell you a little story.”</p>

<p>This I promised very readily; not only to keep him on my
side, but because I saw that he knew much, not generally
known in Sunbury, of the family matters which concerned my
love, and therefore myself, even more than my own. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
while he was busy with his books, which he kept in a fashion
known only to himself, I strolled down the village in the feeble
hope of picking up some tidings. It was pleasant to find,
without saying much, that our neighbours felt a very keen and
kind interest in our doings. There was scarcely a woman who
was not ready to tell me a great deal more than she knew;
and certainly not one who did not consider me badly treated.
Miss Fairthorn, by her sweet appearance and gentle manner,
had made friends in every shop she entered; and the story
of her sudden and compulsory departure became so unsatisfactory,
that deep discredit befell our two policemen. But the
only new point I discovered, bearing at all upon my case, was
gained from Widow Cutthumb. This good lady was now in
bitter feud with the house of Coldpepper, although she made
it clear that the loss of their custom had nothing to do with it,
being rather a benefit than otherwise.</p>

<p>She told me, with much dramatic force, some anecdotes of
Miss Monica, the younger daughter of Squire Nicholas, and a
daughter by no means dutiful. She had married, against her
father’s wish, the Honourable Tom Bulwrag, a gambler, and a
drunkard, and, if reports were true, a forger. As this appears
in my Uncle’s tale, it need not have been referred to, but to
show that the lady’s early records were not fair among us.
After impressing upon me the stern necessity of silence, as to
these and other facts, Mrs. Cutthumb ended with a practical
exhortation, dependent upon the question whether I had a spark
of manhood in me. I replied that I hoped so, but as yet had
few opportunities for testing it.</p>

<p>“Then, Mr. Kit,” she proceeded, with her head thrown
back and one fat hand clenched, “there is only one thing
for you to do—to run away with the young lady. Don’t stop
me, if you please, Master Kit; you have no call to look as if I
spoke treason. Better men than you has done it; and better
young ladies has had to bear it. It is what the Lord has
ordained, whenever He has made two innocent young people,
and the wicked hold counsel together against them. You go
home, and dwell upon it. Sure as I am talking to you now,
you’ll be sorry till your dying day, if you don’t behave a little
spirity. Do you think I would ever give such advice to a wild
young man with no principles, to a fellow I mean like Sam
Henderson? But I know what you are well enough; and
every girl in Sunbury knows. ’Tis not for me to praise you to
your face; but you are that solid and thick-built, that a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
might trust you with her only daughter. And that makes you
slow to look into women. If I may be so bold to ask, how do
you take the meaning of it for that sweet Miss Kitty to be
fetched home so promiscuous?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cutthumb,” I answered, with a penetrating look, to
show her that she underrated me, “I fear it must be that some
mischief-maker has written up to say that I, that I—you know
what I mean, Mrs. Cutthumb.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and you means well so far, and everything
straight-forrard; but you ain’t got near the heart of it, Master
Kit; nor your Uncle neither, I’ll be bound. Wants a woman’s
wits for that.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean? It is bad enough. I don’t
see how even a woman can make it any worse than it is. Speak
out what you mean, since you have begun.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it is no more than this, and you mustn’t be put
out by it. Suppose there is another young gent in the case—a
young gent in London, they means her to marry.”</p>

<p>The goodnatured woman looked so knowing, that I thought
she must have solid proof; and perhaps the deed was done
already. I tried to laugh, but could only stare, and wonder
what was coming next.</p>

<p>“Oh, Master Kit,” she went on with her apron to her eyes,
or she was kind of heart, “you used to come, and play down
here, when your head wasn’t up to the counter. And I had
my Cutthumb then, and he gave you a penny, because you was
so natural. Don’t you be struck of a heap like that, or I shall
come to think that all women is wicked. It was only a bad
thought of my own. I have nothing to go by, if I were to die
this minute; and the same thought might come across any one.
Don’t think no more about it, there’s a dear young man. Only
keep your eyes open, and if you can manage to come across that
stuck-up Jenny Marker, the least she can do, after saving her
life, is to tell you all she knows, and to take your part. But
don’t you believe more than half she says. I never would say
a single word against her, there’s no call for that, being known
as she is to every true woman in Sunbury; but if she’s not a
double-faced gossiping hussy, as fancies that a gold chain makes
a lady of her, and very likely no gold after all, why I should
deserve to be taken up, and there’s no one has ever said
that of me.”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Cutthumb began to cry, at the thought of being
taken to the station; and I saw that time alone could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
comfort her, yet ventured to say a few earnest words, about her
position and high character. And presently she was quite brisk
again.</p>

<p>“Why bless my heart,” she said, looking about for a box of
matches on the onion shelf; “I ought to have stuck up my
candle in the window, pretty well half an hour agone. Not that
no customer comes after dark, nor many by daylight for that
matter. Ah, Master Kit, I am a poor lone widow; but you
are the nicest young man in Sunbury; and I wish you well,
with all my heart I do. And mind one thing, whatever you
do; if you ever carries out what I was saying, here’s the one
as will help you to it, in a humble way, and without much
money. A nice front drawing-room over the shop, bedroom,
and chamber-suit to match. Only twelve shillings a week for it
all, and the use of the kitchen fire for nothing. And the window
on the landing looks on the river Thames, and the boats,
and the barges, and the fishermen. Oh, Mr. Kit, with Mrs.
Kitty now and then, it would be like the Garden of Eden.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>MY UNCLE BEGINS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">That</span> last suggestion was most delicious, but it came too late to
relieve the pang of the horrible idea first presented. I could
not help wondering at my own slow wit, which ought to have
told me that such a treasure as my heart was set upon, must
have been coveted long ere now, by many with higher claims
to it. Was it likely that I, a mere stupid fellow, half a rustic,
and of no position, birth or property, should be preferred to the
wealthy, accomplished, and brilliant men, who were sure to be
gathering round such a prize? Black depression overcame me;
even as the smoke of London, when the air is muggy, falls upon
some country village, wrapping in funereal gloom the church,
the trees, the cattle by the pond, and the man at the window
with his newspaper. I could not see my way to eat much
supper, and my Uncle was crusty with me.</p>

<p>“Can’t stand this much more,” he said, as he finished the
beer that was meant for me; “a plague on all girls, and the
muffs as well that go spooning after them! Why, the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
might just as well never have made a Williams pear, or a cat’s-head
codlin. S’pose you don’t even want to hear my story;
you don’t deserve it anyhow. Better put it off, till you look
brighter, for there isn’t much to laugh at in it, unless it is the
dunder-headed folly of a very clever man.”</p>

<p>However, I begged him to begin at once; for he had hinted
that his tale would throw some light on the subject most important
in the world to me; so I filled him five pipes that he
might not hunt about, and made his glass of rum and water
rather strong, and put the black stool for his legs to rest on, and
drew the red curtains behind his head, for the evening was
chilly, and the fire cheerful.</p>

<p>“Like to do things for myself,” he muttered, while accepting
these little duties. “Nobody else ever does them right, though
meaning it naturally for the best. Well, you want to hear about
those people; and you shall hear all I know, my lad; though
I don’t pretend to know half of all; but what I know I do know,
and don’t talk at random, like the old women here. We’ll take
them in branches—male and female—until they unite, or pretend
to do it; but a very poor splice; the same as you see, if
you send for Camelias to Portugal, a great clumsy stick-out at
the heel of the graft, and the bark grinning open all along.
Bah! There’s no gardeners like Englishmen, though we run
’em down for fear of boasting. Did you ever hear why Professor
Fairthorn would ever so much rather be called ‘Captain,’
though ‘Professor’ sounds ever so much better?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has a legal right to be called ‘Captain,’ but
not to the other title. I have heard that hundreds of people
call themselves Professors, without any right to do it. And I
am sure he would never like to be one of them.”</p>

<p>“That has got nothing to do with it. He has held some
appointment that gave him the right to the title, if he liked it.
The reason is that his wife always calls him ‘Professor’; and
so it reminds him of her. Ah, don’t you be in this outrageous
hurry for a wife of your own, Master Kit, I say. For all I
know, the Captain may have been as wild for her, some time,
as you are for your Kitty. What can you say to that, my lad?”</p>

<p>“Why, simply that you don’t know at all what you are
talking about, Uncle Corny. My Miss Fairthorn is not that
lady’s daughter, and is not to be blamed for the whole of her
sex, any more than you are for the whole of yours.”</p>

<p>“There is something in that, when one comes to see it,”
my Uncle replied; for his mind was generally fair, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
cost him nothing. “But you must not keep on breaking in
like this, or you won’t have heard half of it, this side of Christmas.
Well, I was going to take them according to their sexes,
the same as the Lord made them. And first comes the lady,
as she hath a right to do, being at the bottom of the mischief.</p>

<p>“When I was a young man, thirty year or more agone, there
used to be a lot of talk about the two handsome Miss Coldpeppers,
of the Manor Hall down here. There used to be a lot
also of coaches running, not so much through Sunbury, which
lay to one side of the road, though some used to pass here on
their way to Chertsey; and there was tootle-tootle along father’s
walls, three or four times a day. But the most of them went
further back, along the Staines and Windsor road, where the
noise was something wonderful; and it’s my opinion that these
Railway things will never be able to compare with it. They
may make as much noise for the time, but it seems to be over,
before the boys can holloa.</p>

<p>“Lots of young sparks, and bucks, and dandies, and Corinthians,
and I forget what else, but all much finer than you can
see now, used to come down by the coaches then, some of them
driving, some blowing the horn, some upon the roof like merry-Andrews,
making fools of themselves as we should call it now,
and not be far wrong either. They were much bigger men
than I see now, in their size, and their way of going on, and
their spirits, and their strength of life, and likewise in their
language. And the manners of the time were as different as
can be, more frolicsome like, and more free and jovial; and
they talked about the ladies, and to them also, ten times as
much as they do now; and things were altogether merrier for
them that had the money, and no worse for them that hadn’t
got it, so far as I can see. Ah, there was something to be done
in growing then—pineapples ordered at a guinea a pound, and
grapes at fifteen shillings, though of course you didn’t always
get your money. I’m blest if I won’t have another glass of rum
and water.</p>

<p>“Well, old Squire Nicholas, as they call him now, was as
proud as Punch of his two fine daughters, and expected them
to marry at least an earl apiece, by their faces and fine figures.
And they went about with great folk in Town, and to Court,
and all that sort of thing, looking fit to marry the King almost,
in their velvets, and their satin furbelows. The eldest daughter
was Arabella, our Miss Coldpepper to this day, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was Miss Monica; as fine a pair of women as the Lord ever
made. But for all that, see what they come to!</p>

<p>“There was no love lost between them even then, jealous
of one another no doubt, like two cats over a fish-bone. Some
said that one was the handsomer of them, and some said the
other. There was a good bit of difference between them too,
though any fool could tell they were sisters. Such eyes and
noses as you won’t see now, and hair that would fall to their
knees, I’ve been told, and complexions as clear as a white-heart
cherry, and a cock of the chin, and a lordly walk—they
deserved the name they went by in London, ‘the two Bright
Suns of Sunbury.’ But after all, what good came of it? One
is an old maid, and the other—well, not very likely to go to
heaven, though she hasn’t had much of that yet on earth. Kit,
I have seen a deal of women, as much as is good for any mortal
man; and I tell you the first thing, and the second, and the
third, and the whole to the end of the chapter of them depends
upon their tempers. Ah, those two beauties were beauties at
that; but Miss Monica ever so much the worse.</p>

<p>“It seems that they both might have married very well, if
it had not been for that stumbling-block. Many young women
go on so soft, and eye you so pleasant, and blush so sweet, that
you’d fancy almost there was no such thing as a cross word, or
a spitfire look, or a puckered forehead in their constitution;
and angels is the name for them, until it is too late to fly away.
But these two Misses had never learned how to keep their
tempers under for a week together; and it seems that they never
cared enough for any one to try to do it. Till there came a
man with a temper ten times as bad as both of theirs put
together; and then they fell in love with him hot and hearty.
This was a younger son of Lord Roarmore, a nobleman living
in North Wales, or Ireland—I won’t be certain which—and he
was known as the Honourable Tom Bulwrag. He used to
drive the Windsor coach from London down to Hounslow; for
the passengers could stand him, while the stones and air were
noisy; but there he was forced to get down from the box; for
nothing that lived, neither man, nor horse, nor cow in the
ditch, could endure this gentleman’s language, when there was
too much silence to hear it in.</p>

<p>“I suppose he was quiet among the ladies, as many men are,
who can speak no good. And perhaps our two ladies fell in
love with him, because he was a bigger sample of themselves.
Not that they ever used swearing words, only thought them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
as it were, and let other people know it. Any way, both of
them took a fancy to him, though their father would not hear
of it; for the gentleman was not wealthy enough to have any
right to such wickedness. Perhaps that made them like him all
the more, for they always flew in the face of Providence. And
for doing of that, they both paid out, as generally happens here,
that we may see it.</p>

<p>“So far as I can tell, and I had better chances of knowing
than any one else outside the house, everything was settled for
the Honourable Tom to run away to Bath with Miss Arabella,
with special licence, and everything square. But whether she
was touched in heart about her father (whose favourite she had
always been), or whether her lover came out too strong in his
usual style, or whether her sister Monica had egged her on to
it, sure enough she blazed out into such a fury, just when they
were starting, and carried on so reckless, that the Honourable
Tom, who had never quite made up his mind, was frightened
of what she would be by-and-by, and locked her in a tool-house
at the bottom of the grounds, and set off with Miss Monica that
same hour, changing the name in the licence, and married her.</p>

<p>“Without being too particular, you might fairly suppose that
a job of this kind was not likely to end well. Miss Monica
had taken with her one—what shall I say? Certainly not
servant, nor attendant, nor inferior in any way—”</p>

<p>My uncle here seemed to feel a certain want of power to
express himself; and I knew that he was beating about the
bush of the one and only one romance of his dry and steady
life. He turned away, so that I could not see his eyes, and
I did not wish to look at them.</p>

<p>“Well, that is neither here nor there,” he continued, after
pushing more tobacco into a pipe too full already; “but she
took away a young lady of this neighbourhood, to whom she
appeared to be much attached, and who alone had any power to
control her furious outbreaks, just because she always smiled at
them, as soon as they were over. The sweet-tempered girl
could never quite believe that the Fury was in earnest, because
it was so far beyond her own possibilities; and the woman of
fury did a far worse thing than the wrecking of her own stormy
life, she also wrecked a sweet, and gentle, loving, and reasonable
heart. Never mind that; it often happens, and what
does the selfish Fury care? Miss Monica became, as I have said,
the Honourable Mrs. Bulwrag, and then she reaped the harvest
she had sown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“For in the first place Viscount Roarmore, being a hot-headed
man likewise, stopped every farthing of his son’s allowance,
and said—‘Go to your new father. Your pretty cousin
Rose, with five thousand pounds a year, was ready to marry you,
in spite of all your sins, and you had promised to marry her.
You have taken one of those two girls, who were called the
“Bright Suns of Sunbury,” till people found out what they
were, and called them the two “Raging Suns.” Now rage her
down, if you can, and you ought to be more than a match for a
woman. In any case, expect no more from me.’</p>

<p>“Then the young man came to Squire Nicholas, and screwed
himself down to eat humble pie. But the Squire said, ‘Sir,
you have married my daughter without asking my leave, and
against it. I still have a dutiful daughter left. She is my
only one henceforth.’ Then the young man broke into the
strongest language ever yet heard at Coldpepper Hall, although
it had never been weak in that line. He was very soon shown
the outside of the door, and got drunk for the night at the
‘Bell and Dragon.’</p>

<p>“Then began the rough-and-tumble work between those
two—the hugging and the hating, the billing and the bullying,
the kissing and the kicking, all and every up and down of laughing,
sobbing, scratching, screeching, that might be in a wild
hyena’s den. How they contrived to hold together so long as
they did, Heaven only knows, or perhaps the opposite place to
Heaven. There must have been some fierce love between
them, some strange suitability; as if each perceived the worst
part of himself or herself in the other, and flew to it, as well as
flew at it. What kept them together was a mystery; but what
kept them alive was a darker one. Without friends, or money,
or credit, or visible robbery, they fought on together, for five
or even six years, now here and now there. Three children
they had, and fought over them of course, and perhaps began to
teach them to fight each other, at least so far as example goes.</p>

<p>“But suddenly this queer union was broken up for ever.
Mr. Bulwrag did something which risked his neck; he believed
that Squire Nicholas was bound to contribute to the support of
his grandchildren, and he made him do his duty, without
knowing it. Then, having arranged for a three-days’ start, he
was well upon his voyage before pursuit began. It is not very
easy to catch a man now, when he has a good start, and knows
the world; but five and twenty years ago, it was generally
given up as a bad job; unless the reward was astounding. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
reward was offered, and the Honourable Tom was next heard
of from South America, where there seemed to be a lot of little
States, which never allow their civil wars to abate their wars
with one another. This condition of things was exactly to his
taste; his courage and strong language made their way; he
commanded the forces of one great Republic, with the title of
‘Marshal Torobelle,’ and he promised to send some money
home in the last letter ever received from him.</p>

<p>“His deserted wife said after that, that she truly would
believe in everything, if she ever saw a ten-pound note from
her beloved husband. But she never was put to the trial, for
the next news was that he was dead. He had found it much
to his advantage to learn to swear in Spanish; and being proud
of this, because he had little other gift of lingo, he tried it upon
a young Spanish officer, who did not take it cordially. After
parade, they had a private fight, and Marshal Torobelle could
swear no more, even in his native language. His friends, for
he seems to have been liked out there, wrote a very kind letter
in bad French, telling how grand he had been, and how faithful,
but grieving that he had left no affairs, to place them in a
state to remember him. Then the Marshal’s widow bought
expensive mourning, for he had left with her a thousand pounds
of the proceeds of his forgery, and wrote to his father, Lord
Roarmore.</p>

<p>“Kit, I have found that one can generally tell what a man
will do, in certain cases, from a rough outline of his character.
What a woman will do, no man can tell, though he fancies he
knows her thoroughly. My Lord Roarmore was a violent man,
and hot more than hard in his resolution. And he took it very
kindly that his son, when driven hard, had forged the name of
the father-in-law, and not of the father, as he might have done.
He was beginning to relent already, and finding it too late,
naturally relented altogether. He talked of his noble and
gallant son, and although himself in difficulties, bravely settled
five hundred pounds a year upon the widow and the little ones.</p>

<p>“I dare say you are surprised, my lad, that I should have
come to know so much of this unhappy story; more I believe
than is even known by the lady’s own sister—our Miss Coldpepper.
Women are slower to forgive than men, and slower in
beginning to be forgiven. Arabella has never forgiven her
sister for running away with her lover; and Monica has never
forgiven her sister for making such a fuss about it. They may
try to pull together, when it suits their purpose; but the less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they see of one another, the greater the chance of their reconciliation.
But I am not come to the poor Captain yet; and,
bless my heart, it is ten o’clock! What a time to stay up about
other people’s business! If you want to hear the rest, you
must have it to-morrow.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>AND ENDS WITH A MORAL.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> through the following day, we were forced to be hard at
work, whether we liked it or not, gathering a large lot of early
apples, such as Keswick, Sugarloaf, and Julien, which would
have been under the trees by this time in an early season.
But this, through the chill and continual rain of the time that
should have been summer, was the latest season within human
memory; which (like its owners) is not very long. And now
a break-up of the weather was threatened, at which we could
not grumble, having now enjoyed ten days without any rain—a
remarkable thing in much better years than this. And in
this year it truly was a God-send, helping us to make some
little push, before the winter closed over us, and comforting
us to look up to Heaven, without being almost beaten down.
The people who live in great cities, where they need only go a
few yards all day long, and can get beneath an awning or an
archway, if a drop of rain disturbs their hats, give the weather
ten bad words for every one we give it; though we are bound
to work in it, and worse than that, have our livelihood hanging
upon it. Not that we are better pleased than they; only that
our more wholesome life, and the strength of the trees, and
the unexhausted air, perhaps put into us a kinder spirit to
make the best of things that are ordered from above.</p>

<p>Few things in the manner of ordinary work become more
wearisome after a while than the long-continued gathering of
fruit. The scent, which is delightful to those who catch a
mere whiff of it in going by, becomes most cloying and even
irksome to those who have it all day in their nostrils. And
the beauty of the form and colour too, and the sleek gloss of
each fine sample, lose all their delight in the crowd of their
coming, and make us even long to see the last of them. Every
man of us, even Uncle Corny, to whom every basket was grist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
for the mill, felt heartily glad when streaky sunset faded
softly into dusk, when flat leaf looked as round as fruit, and
apples knocked our heads instead of gliding into the ready
hand.</p>

<p>“Now mind one thing,” said my uncle with a yawn, when
after a supper of liver and bacon knowingly fried by Mrs.
Tabby, his pipe was between his teeth and all his other needs
were toward; “if I go on with my tale to-night, I am likely
enough to leave out something which may be the gist of it.
For I feel that sleepy, after all this job, that I can scarcely keep
my pipe alight. However, you have worked well to-day, and
shown no white feather for your sweetheart’s sake; and of
course you want to know most about her, and how she comes
into this queer tale. Poor young thing, she smiles as sweetly,
as if she trod a path of roses, instead of nettles, and briars,
and flint! Ah, I suppose she forgets her troubles, whenever
she looks at you, my lad.” This made my heart beat faster
than any words of his tale I had heard till now.</p>

<p>“As if she cared for me! As if it were possible for any
one to imagine that she would ever look twice at me! Uncle
Corny, I thought you were a wiser man.” I hoped that this
might lead him on.</p>

<p>“To be sure, I was making a mistake,” he answered,
looking as if it were just the same thing. “When I said you,
I meant of course Sam Henderson, the racing man. That’s the
young fellow that has her heart. How beautifully she smiled
when I mentioned him, and blushed when I said he was the
finest fellow anywhere round Sunbury, and the steadiest, and
the cleverest.</p>

<p>“No, no, Kit; it’s all my fun. You needn’t be looking at the
carving-knife. You know how I hate Sam Henderson, a stuck-up
puppy, and a black-leg too, according to my ideas. A girl
who respects herself, as your Kitty does, would have nothing
to say to him. But she might to a fine young gardener
perhaps.</p>

<p>“Well, I have told you all about the first marriage and the
widowhood of that precious Monica Coldpepper. What fools
men are—what wondrous fools! Here was a widow, not over
young, with a notorious temper, and no money, or none of her
own at any rate, and hampered with three children—let me
tell you their names while I think of it, Euphrasia, Donovan,
and Geraldine—there’s no duty to pay on a name, you know.
Now would not any one have sworn that a woman like that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
might wear the weeds, until she had stormed herself to death?
Not a bit of it, my lad; she married again, and she married
the cleverest man in London; and more than that, she got
every farthing of his property settled upon her, although the
poor man had a child of his own! And I am told that she
might have had a dozen other men.</p>

<p>“She was still a fine woman certainly, for it must have been
some twelve years ago; and she is a fine woman to this very
day, according to those who have seen her; which I hope I
may never do, for reasons I will not go into. But beside her
appearance, what one thing was there to lead a sane man to
marry her? And a man who had lost a sweet-tempered wife,
a beautiful, loving, and modest woman, as like your Kitty as
two peas! Sometimes I feel sorry for him, when I think of
his former luck; and sometimes I am glad that he is served
out, for making such a horrible fool of himself. Nearly any
other man would have hung himself, for the lady has gone from
bad to worse, and is now a thorough termagant; but this man
endures her as if she were his fate. Do you know who he is?
You must know now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have known it, since you began; and from what
other people said, I suspected it before.” As I answered thus,
I was thinking how this condition of things would affect my
chance.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem at all astonished, Kit;” my uncle went
on with some disappointment at losing his sensation. “You
young folk have so little sense, that you make it a point of
honour never to be surprised by anything. If anybody had
told me, without my knowing it already, that a man of great
intellect, like Professor Fairthorn, would make such a fool of
himself, and then submit to have no life of his own, I should
have said it was a crazy lie. But there is the truth, my boy,
not to be got over; and far worse than at first sight appears. A
man who robs himself may be forgiven; but not a man who
robs his children. It is the difference between suicide and
murder.</p>

<p>“Very likely, you are surprised that I, who have not a
sixpence at stake, and not even a friend involved in the matter,
should get so hot about it, as I can’t help being. There are
plenty of viragoes in the world; there are plenty of good men
who cower before them, for the sake of their own coward
peace; also there are robberies in abundance, of children who
cannot defend themselves, and of people who can—so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that goes. And ninety-nine men in a hundred would say—‘Well,
this is no concern of mine. It is a very sad and shameful
thing, but it does not touch my bread and cheese. Great
is truth, and it will prevail; and I hope I may live to see it.’
But, Kit, my boy, the worst wrong of all was mine. A deadlier
wrong has been done to me, than of money or lands, or household
peace. My life has been wrecked by that devil of a
woman, as if it were a toy-boat she sunk with her slipper. I
did not mean to tell you—an old man cannot bear to talk of
such things to young people. Is your whole heart set upon
your Kitty?”</p>

<p>I had never seen my uncle so disturbed before; and, to tell
the plain truth, I was frightened by it. Sometimes I had
seen him in a little passion, when he found a man he
trusted robbing him, or the dealers cheated him beyond the
right margin, or some favourite plant was kicked over; but he
never lost his power then of ending with a smile, and a little
turn of words would change his temper. But this was no
question of temper now. His solid face was hardened, as if
cast in stone; not a feature of it moved, but his grey curls
trembled in the draught, and his hand upon the table quivered.
I answered that my whole heart was set upon my Kitty, but I
knew that I should never win her.</p>

<p>“If she is true to you, you shall. That is, if you behave
as a man should do;” he spoke very slowly, and with a low
voice, almost as if talking to himself; “if you are wise enough
to let no lies, or doubts, or false pride come between you.
There is no power but the will of God, that can keep asunder
a man and woman who have given their lives to each other.
All the craft, and falsehood, and violence of the world melt
away like a mist, if they stand firm and faithful, and abide
their time. But it must hold good on both sides alike. Both
must disdain every word that comes from lying lips, from the
lips of all, whether true or false, except one another. Remember,
that is the rule, my lad, if rogues and scoundrels,
male or female, come between you and the one you love. It
has been a black streak in my life. It has kept me lonely in
the world. Sometimes it seems to knock me over still. I
have not spoken of it for years; and I cannot speak of it even
now any more—not any more.”</p>

<p>He rose from his chair, and went about the room, as if it
were his life, in which he was searching for something he should
never find. To turn his thoughts, and relieve my own, I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a clean pipe and filled it; and began to puff as if I liked it,
although in those days I seldom smoked. This had been always
a reproach against me; for a smoker seems to love a contribution
to his cloud.</p>

<p>“Well done, Kit, you are a sensible fellow;” said my uncle,
returning to his usual mood. “Tobacco is the true counterblast
to care. You take up your pipe, and I will take up my parable,
without going into my own affairs. I never told you how that
confounded woman—the Lord forgive me if I bear malice, for
I trust that He shares it with me—how she contrived to hook
the poor Professor, and, what is still worse, every farthing of
his money.</p>

<p>“Not that I believe, to give the devil his due, that she sought
him first for the sake of his money. He had not very much of
that—for it seldom goes with brains that stamp their own coinage—but
through his first wife, a beautiful and loving woman,
he owned a nice house with large premises, in a rich part of
London, or rather of the outskirts, where values were doubling
every year, as the builders began to rage round it. Also he had
about five thousand pounds of hers, which was not under settlement,
and perhaps about the same amount of his own, not made
by himself (for he had no gift of saving) but coming from his
own family. Altogether he was worth about twenty thousand
pounds; which he justly intended for his only child.</p>

<p>“This was pretty handsome, as you would say, and he took
care not to imperil it, by any of his patents, or other wasteful
ways. He had been for many years in the Royal Navy, and
commanded at one time a new-fangled ship, with iron sheathings,
or whatever they are called, which are now superseding
the old man-of-war. Here he had seemed to be in his proper
element, for he knew the machinery and all that, as well as the
makers did, and much better than any of the engineers on
board; and he might have been promoted to almost anything,
except for his easy-going nature. He had not the sternness, and
strength of will, which were needful in his position; and
though everybody loved and respected him, the discipline of
the ship in minor matters fell abroad, and he was superseded.</p>

<p>“This cut him to the quick, as you may suppose; for he still
was brooding over the loss of his first dear wife, which had
befallen him, while he was away on some experimental cruise.
Between the two blows, he was terribly out of heart, and came
back to his lonely London house, in the state of mind, which is
apt to lay a man at the mercy of a crafty and designing woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Unhappily he was introduced just then to Mrs. Bulwrag; and
she fell in love with him, I do believe, as far as she was capable
of doing it. Though she might have flown, and had been
flying at higher game in a certain sense, she abandoned all
others, and set the whole strength of her will, which was great,
upon conquering him. She displayed the most tender and
motherly interest in his little darling daughter; she was breathless
with delight at his vast scientific attainments, and noble
discoveries; she became the one woman in all the world, who
could enter into his mind, and second his lofty ideas for the
grandeur of humanity. Unluckily they were so far apart in
their natures, that no collision yet ensued, which might have
laid bare her true character, and enforced the warnings of his
many friends. Not to make too long a story of it, she led him
to the matrimonial altar—as the papers call it—without any
solicitor for his best man, but a very sharp one behind her.
With the carelessness of a man of genius, added to his own
noble faith in woman, he had signed a marriage settlement,
which gave her not only a life-interest in all his property, but
a separate power of disposal by assignment, which might be
exercised at any time. And the trustees were old allies of
hers, who were not beyond suspicion of having been something
even more than that.</p>

<p>“However, she loved her dear Professor—as she insisted on
calling him—for a certain time, with the fervour of youth,
though she must have been going on for forty, and she led him
about in high triumph, and your Kitty was sent to a poor
boarding-school. ‘The Honourable Mrs. Bulwrag-Fairthorn,’
as, in defiance of custom, she engraved herself, became quite
the fashion among a certain lot, and aspired to climb yet higher.
For if she has a weakness, it is to be among great people, and in
high society. She changed the name of the poor Professor’s
house at South Kensington to ‘Bulwrag Park,’ she thought nothing
of paying thirty pounds for a dress, and she gave large parties
all the night long. Meanwhile he went about his work, and she
took possession of every halfpenny he earned, and spent it on herself
and her children. Her boy and two girls were pampered
and indulged, while Kitty was starved and threadbare.</p>

<p>“You have seen the sort of man he is—simple, quiet, and
unpretending, full of his own ideas and fancies, observing everything
in the way of nature, but caring very little for the ways
of men. He kept himself out of the whirl she lived in, and
tried to believe that she was a good, though rather noisy woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
But suddenly all his good-will was shattered, and he nearly
shared the same fate himself.</p>

<p>“He was sitting up very late one night, in the little room
allowed to him for the various tools, and instruments, and
appliances, and specimens, and all that sort of thing, which
were the apple of his eye; and by a special light of his own
devising he was working up the finish of some grand experiment,
from which he expected great wonders, no doubt. I don’t know
how many kinds of acid he had got in little bottles, and how
many—I don’t know what their names are, but something of a
kail, like ‘Ragged Jack;’ and how many other itemies—as
Tabby Tapscott calls them—the Lord only knoweth, who made
them; and perhaps the men have got beyond even Him. At
any rate, there he was, all in his glory; and he would have
given ten years of his life, to be let alone for an hour or two.
But suddenly the door flew open, as if with a strong kick;
and the shake, and the draught, set his flames and waters
quivering. He looked up with his mild eyes, and beheld a
Fury.</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean by this?’ she cried. ‘Here I come
home from Lord Oglequince’s, where you left me to go by
myself, as usual; and on my red Davenport I find this! A
fine piece of extravagance! Whose money is it?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, Monica, it was not meant to go to you,’ the
Professor replied; for he saw what it was, a bill of about three
pounds, for a cloak, and a skirt, and a hat, or some such
things, which his daughter’s school-mistress had written for,
because the poor girl was unfit to be seen with the rest. ‘My
dear, I will pay it, of course. You have nothing to do with it.
It was put on your desk by mistake altogether.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, then you mean to do it on the sly! To spend on
this little upstart of yours the money that belongs to my poor
children. Whose house is this? Whose chair are you sitting
on—for of course you never have the manners to rise, when a
lady comes to speak to you? Do you think you will ever
make a penny, by all your trumpery dibbles and dabbles? I
hate the sight of them, and I will not allow them. Hand me
that cane, with the sponge at the end.’</p>

<p>“The Captain arose under her rebuke, and looked at her
with calm curiosity, as if she were part of his experiment.
He had never seen a case of such groundless fury, and could
scarcely believe that it was real. Her blazing eyes were fixed
on his, and her figure seemed to tower, in her towering rage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Such folly however could not frighten him; and he smiled, as
if looking at a baby, while he handed her the cane.</p>

<p>“‘You laugh at me, do you? You think I am your
slave?’ she cried as she swung the cane round her head, and
he fully expected the benefit. ‘Because I am a poor weak
woman, I am to be trampled on in my own house, and come
on my knees, at these shameful hours, to hold all your gallipots
and phials for you. Look, this is the way I serve your grand
science! There go a few of them, and there, and there! How
do you like that, Professor?—Oh, oh, oh!’</p>

<p>“At the third sweep of the cane among his chemical
treasures, she had dashed on the floor, among many other
things, a small stoppered bottle full of caustic liquid, and a fair
dose had fallen on her instep, which was protected by nothing
but a thin silk stocking. Screeching with pain, she danced
round the room, and then fell upon a chair, and began to tear
her hair, in a violent fit of hysterics.</p>

<p>“‘It is painful for the moment; but there is no serious
harm,’ said the Captain, as he rang the bell for her own
attendant; ‘fortunately the contents of that bottle were
diluted, or she might never have walked again; if indeed such
a style of progress is to be called walking. It is most unwise
of any tiro to interfere with these little inquiries. I was very
near a fine result; and now, I fear, it is all scattered.’</p>

<p>“The next day he did, what he should have done some
months ago. He took the copy of his marriage-settlement to a
good solicitor, and found, to his sad astonishment, that the
boasts of the termagant were too true. Under the provisions
of that document—as atrocious a swindle as was ever perpetrated—he
could be turned out of his own house, and the
property he intended for his own child was at the mercy of her
stepmother.</p>

<p>“From the lawyer he got not a crumb of comfort. The
settlement was his own act and deed; there was no escaping
from it. It had been prepared by the lady’s solicitors; and he
had signed it without consideration. All very true; but he
should have considered, and marriage was a consideration, in
the eye of the law, and a binding one. If the Professor wished,
the solicitor would take Counsel’s opinion, whether there might
be any chance of obtaining redress from Equity. But he felt
sure, that to do so would only be a waste of money. It was a
most irregular thing, that in such an arrangement, one side
only should be represented; but that was the fault of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
other side, which surrendered its own interests. In fact, it
was a very fine instance of confidence in human nature; and
human nature had been grateful enough to make the most of
the confidence offered.</p>

<p>“If you did not know what the Professor is, you might
suppose, Kit, that he was overcome, and overwhelmed with the
result of his own neglect and softness. Not a bit of it; in a
week’s time, he had mended all his broken apparatus; and the
only difference to be noticed was, that he never began work
without locking the door. His treatment of his wife was the
same as ever. He bore no ill-will, or at any rate showed none,
on account of that strong explosion; and he took thenceforth
all her fits of fury as gusts of wind, that had got in by mistake.
It is impossible for any woman to make a man of that nature
unhappy. He would have been happier, I dare say, and have
done much more for the good of the world, if he had married a
peaceful woman; but I know very little of those matters. Only,
as you have an ordinary mind, be sure that you marry a sweet-tempered
woman. To bed, my boy, to bed! We must be up
right early.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>MORAL SUPPORT.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of all said to the contrary, I believe that young people,
upon the whole, are more apt to ponder than the old folk are.
At least, if to ponder means—as it should—to weigh in the
balance of pros and cons the probable results of their own doings.
The old man remembers the time he has lost, in thinking
thoughts that came to naught; and he sees that if they had
come to much, that much would have been very little now.
The young man has plenty of time on his hands, and believes
he is going to do wonders with it, and makes a bright map of
his mighty course in life. And this is the wisest thing that he
can do.</p>

<p>But when he falls in love, alas! his ripe wisdom is seldom
applied to himself. Like a roguish grocer, with a magnet in
his counter, he brings the scale down to his own liking; but
he differs from him, in that he cheats himself.</p>

<p>Being very wise in my own eyes, I pondered very carefully
my next step; not with any thought of retiring, but with a firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
resolve to advance in the strongest and most effective manner.
My Uncle’s long story, instead of damping, had added hot fuel
to my ardour, and compassion had lent a deeper tone to passion.
Tender pictures arose before me of my angelic Kitty, starved,
and tortured, and snubbed, and trampled, and (worst of all
perhaps to a female body) shabbily, and grotesquely dressed.
Such a woman as my uncle had described was enough to drive
the largest-minded man to fury, and to grind the sweetest of
her own sex, into fragments of misery and despair. The one
crumb of comfort I could pick up, was that such cruelty must
make my darling pine all the more for tender love, and long
perpetually for some refuge, however humble it might be. But
the point of all points was—how should I get at her?</p>

<p>All these things were passing through my mind for about
the thousandth time—yet all in vain—as I came back from
Chertsey, on old <i>Spanker’s</i> back, a day or two later in that same
week. Old <i>Spanker</i> was as good a horse as ever tasted corn;
and when we got together, we always seemed to fall into very
much the same vein of thought. Not that <i>Spanker</i> had any
love troubles, but plenty of other cares and considerations, which
brought him into tune with me, as we jogged along. If anything
went amiss on our premises, <i>Spanker</i> seemed to find it
out, not one of us knew how, and to feel a friendly sadness for
us, though it never affected his appetite. So warm was his
interest in our affairs, that whenever he took a load to Covent
Garden, the proper thing always was to let him know how it
had been disposed of; and Selsey Bill declared that he came
home with his ears pricked forward, or laid back, according as
the prices had been up or down. But Selsey Bill, with seventeen
hungry children, was himself as sympathetic as almost any
horse.</p>

<p>It was very nigh dark; for the days were drawing in, being
nearly come to the equinox, and the weather breaking up, as we
had foreseen. Indeed but for that, I should not have been
here, for my uncle would never have sent me to Chertsey, if
the fruit had been fit to be gathered to-day. “Never gather
any fruit when it is wet, except a horse-chestnut,” he used to
say; “and you may find the flavour of that improved.” But
the rain had not been so very heavy, only just enough to hang
on things and make them sticky; and now there was a strong
wind getting up, which was likely to fetch down a hundred
bushels.</p>

<p>The river was no longer in high flood, though still over its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
banks, and turbulent; and I had not to ride through great
stretches of water, as our roads require one to do, even if they
let him pass at all, when the Thames comes down at its
utmost. When I was a lad in 1852, we could scarcely go anywhere
without swimming. And now, without floods, I very
nearly had to swim; for old <i>Spanker</i> stopped as suddenly as if
he had been shot, in a dark place, where there was a ditch
beside the road; and I, riding carelessly and mooning on my
grievances, was as loose on his back as my hat on my head. I
just saved myself from flying over his ears, and then flourished
my whipstock, for I thought it was a footpad.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Kit. You have done a little too much
of that to me already.”</p>

<p>The voice was well known to me, and the glimmering light
showed the figure of Sam Henderson. He had a contemptuous
manner of putting his heels on the earth, with his toes turned
up and out; as if the world were not worth riding, except
with a reckless attitude. But I was vexed to be pulled up like
this, and nearly cast out of the saddle. Therefore I said something
of his own sort.</p>

<p>“Young man, you don’t value my good intentions; and you
are not at all charmed with my new dodge, for fetching a horse
up before he can think. You saw I never touched your bridle.
Well, never mind that. I’m not going to teach you. How are
things going on, at your crib, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Famously;” I answered, for it was not likely that I should
discourse of my troubles to him. “Nothing could be better,
Mr. Henderson; and since you have proved your new dodge
satisfactory, I will say ‘Good-night,’ and beg you not to do it
to me again.”</p>

<p>“What a confounded muff you are!” he continued with
his slangy drawl, which he had picked up perhaps at Tattersall’s;
“do you think that I would have come down this
beastly lane, on a dirty night like this, without I had something
important to say? How about your Kitty?”</p>

<p>This was a little too familiar, and put me on my dignity.
At the same time it gave me a thrill of pleasure, as a proof
of the public conclusion upon a point of deep private interest.</p>

<p>“If you happen to mean, in your cheeky style, a young
lady known as Miss Fairthorn, and the niece of Miss Coldpepper,
of the Hall; I can only tell you that she is in London, with
her father, the celebrated Captain Fairthorn.”</p>

<p>“A pinch for stale news—as we used to say at school.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Perhaps I could give you a fresher tip, my boy; but I daresay
you don’t care to hear it. Perhaps you have put your money
on another filly. So have I; and this time it is a ripper.”</p>

<p>Little as I liked his low manner of describing things too
lofty for his comprehension, I could not let him depart like
this. He lit a cigar under <i>Spanker’s</i> nose, as if he had been
nobody, and whistling to his bull-terrier Bob, turned away as
if everything was settled. But I called him back sternly, and
he said, “Oh well, if you want to hear more, you must turn
into my little den down here.”</p>

<p>I followed him through a white gate which he opened in the
high paling that fenced his paddocks, and presently we came to a
long low building, more like a shed than a dwelling-house, but
having a snug room or two at one end. “This is my doctor’s
shop,” he said; “and it serves for a thousand other uses. No
patients at present—will be plenty by-and-by. Come into my
snuggery, and have something hot. I will send a fellow home
with your old screw, and tell the governor not to expect you
to supper. Rump-steak and onions in ten minutes, Tom, and a
knife and fork for this gentleman! Now, Kit, put your
trotters on the hob, but have a pull first at this pewter.”</p>

<p>This was heaping coals of fire on my head, after all that I
had done to him; and I said something clumsy to that effect.
He treated it as if it were hardly worth a word; and much as I
love to be forgiven, I like to have done it to others much
better.</p>

<p>“I never think twice of a thing like that,” he replied, without
turning to look at me. “A fellow like you who never sees
a bit of life gets waxy over nothing, and makes a fool of himself.
You hit straight, and I deserved it. I live among horses
a deal too much to bear ill-will, as the humans do. Let us
have our corn, my boy; and then I will tell you what I heard
in town to-day, and you can grind it between your wisdom
teeth.”</p>

<p>In spite of all anxiety, I did well with the victuals set before
me; and Sam was right hospitable in every way, and made me
laugh freely at his short crisp stories, with a horse for the hero,
and a man for the rogue, or even a woman in some cases. I
endeavoured to match some of them with tales of our own nags,
but those he swept by disdainfully. No horse was worth talking
of below the rank of thoroughbred; as a story has no
interest, until we come to the Earls, and the Dukes, and the
Marquises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now,” said Sam Henderson, when the plates were gone,
and glasses had succeeded them; “Kit Orchardson, you are a
very pleasant fellow; considering how little you know of the
world, I never thought there was so much in you. Why, if
you could get over your shyness, Kit, you would be fit for
very good society. But it is a mistake on the right side, my
boy. I would much rather see a young chap like that, than
one of your bumptious clodhoppers. I suppose I am the only
man in Sunbury who ever goes into high society. And I take
good care that it never spoils me. There is not a Lord on the
turf that won’t shake hands with me, when he thinks I can
put him up to anything. But you can’t say I am stuck up, can
you now?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” I declared with warmth, for his hospitality
was cordial; “you keep to your nature through the whole of
it. It would spoil most of us to have so much to do with
noblemen.”</p>

<p>“You and I should see more of one another,” Sam answered,
with gratification beaming in his very keen and lively
eyes; “and if ever you would put a bit of Uncle Corny’s tin upon
any tit at long odds, come to me. The finest tip in England
free, gratis, and for nothing. But I called you in for a different
sort of tip. When I was at the corner this afternoon, who
should I see but Sir Cumberleigh Hotchpot? I dare say you
may have heard of him. No? Very well, that proves just what
I was saying. You are as green as a grasshopper looking at a
cuckoo. ‘Pot,’ as we call him—and it fits him well, for his
figure is that, and his habits are black—is one of the best-known
men in London, and one of the worst to have much to
do with. ‘Holloa, Sam,’ he says, ‘glad to see you. What’ll
you take for your old <i>Sinner</i> now?’ <i>Sinner</i>, you must know, is
my old mare <i>Cinnaminta</i>, the dam of more winners than any
other mare alive; and the old rogue knows well enough that I
would sooner sell my shadow, even if he had sixpence to put
on it. He gives himself out to be rolling in money, but all he
ever rolls in is the gutter. Well, sir, we got on from one thing
to another; and by-and-by I gave him just a little rub about a
hatful of money I had won of him at Chester, and never seen
the colour of. ‘All right,’ he says, ‘down upon the nail next
week. Haven’t you heard what’s up with me?’ So I told
him no, and he falls to laughing, enough to shake the dye out
of his grizzly whiskers. ‘Going to buckle to. By Gosh, I
mean it,’ says he; ‘and the sweetest young filly as ever looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
through a riband. Rejoices in the name of Kitty Fairthorn,
just the very name for the winner of the Oaks. Ha, ha, wish
me joy, old chap. She was down your way, I am told, last
week. But I had spotted her before that, Sam.’ I was thrown
upon my haunches, as you may fancy, Kit; but I did not let
him see it; though to think of old Crumbly Pot going in for
such a stunner—‘Rhino, no doubt,’ I says; and he says, ‘By
the bucketful! Her dad is a buffer who can sit down and
coin it in batteries. And only this kid to put it on; the others
belong to a different stable. Think of coming for the honeymoon,
down to your place. They tell me you keep the big crib
empty.’ Well I only shook my head at that, for the old rogue
never pays his rent; and I asked him when it was to be pulled
off. ‘Pretty smart,’ he said; but the day not named, and he
must go first to Lincolnshire, to see about his property there;
which I happen to know is up the spout to its outside value,
though he always talks big on the strength of it. And no
doubt he has got over your grand Professor, with his baronetcy
and his flourishing estates. That’s about the tune of it, you
may swear, Kit. Well, how do you like my yarn, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Sam, it shall never come off;” I cried, with a stamp which
made the glasses jingle, and the stirrup-irons that hung on the
wall rattle as if a mad horse were between them. “I would
rather see that innocent young creature in her coffin than
married to such a low brute. Why, even if she married
you, Sam, although it would be a terrible fall, she would have
a man, and an honest one comparatively to deal with. But as
to the Crumbly Pot, as you call him—”</p>

<p>“Well, old fellow, you mean well,” replied Henderson with
tranquillity; “though your compliments are rather left-handed.
But you may look upon me, Kit, as out of the running. I
was taken with the girl, I won’t deny it. But she didn’t take
to me, and she took to you. And between you and me, I am
as sure as eggs that she hasn’t got sixpence to bless herself.
That wouldn’t suit my book; and I am no plunger.”</p>

<p>“She wants no sixpence to bless herself. She is blest
without a halfpenny. And a blessing she will be to any man
who deserves her, although there is none on the face of this
earth—”</p>

<p>“Very well, very well—stow all that. A woman’s a dark
horse, even to her own trainer. But I’ve met with just as fine
a bit of stuff, a lovely young filly down at Ludred. She’s the
only daughter of the old man there; and if ever I spotted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Derby nag, he has got the next one in his string this moment. I
have not quite made up my mind yet; but I think I shall go
in for her. At any rate I’m off with the Fairthorn lay. Why,
there’s a cuss of a woman to deal with there, who’d frighten a
dromedary into fits, they say. I wonder if old Pot knows
about it. But Pot shan’t have her, if I can help it; and you
may trust me for knowing a thing or two. Come, let’s strike
a bargain, Kit, and stick to it like men. Will you help me
with the Ludred job, if I do all I can for you in the Fairthorn
affair? Give me your hand on it, and I am your man.”</p>

<p>I told him that I did not see at all how I could be of any
service to him, in his scheme on the young lady he was
thinking of. But he said that I could help him as much as I
liked; for a relative of mine lived in that village, an elderly
lady, and highly respected, as she occupied one of the best
houses in the place; and more than that, it belonged to her.
It was some years now since I had seen her, but she had been
kind to me when I was at school; and Sam proposed that I
should look her up, and give a bright account of him, and
perhaps do more than that; for the young lady visited at her
house, and valued her opinion highly. I now perceived why
Henderson had become so friendly, and was able to trust him,
as he had a good motive. Moreover I had heard of his “lovely
filly,” and even seen her when she was a child; and I knew
that her father (the well-known Mr. Chalker) had made a good
fortune in the racing business, and perhaps would be apt to
look down upon Sam, from the point of higher standing and
better breeding. Being interested now in all true love, I
readily promised to do all I could, and then begged for Sam’s
counsel in my own case.</p>

<p>“Take the bull by the horns;” he said with his usual
briskness. “Never beat about the bush; that’s my plan, Kit.
Go up, and see the governor, and say,—‘I love your daughter;
I hear she is awfully sat upon at home, and doesn’t even get her
corn regular. She has taken a great liking to me; I know
that. And although I am not a great gun, and am terribly
green, my Uncle Corny is a warm old chap; and I shall have
all his land and money, when he croaks. You see, governor,
you might do worse. And as for old Pot, if you knew the old
scamp, you’d sooner kill your girl than let him have her. Why,
he can’t even square his bets; and all his land in Lincolnshire
is collared by the Moseys. Hand her to me, and I’ll make her
a good husband, and you shall come to our place, and live jolly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
when you can’t stand your devil of a wife no longer.’ Kit, I’ll
write it down for you, if you like. You say all that to him,
exactly as I said it; and if you don’t fetch him, turn me out to
grass in January.”</p>

<p>I was much amused that Henderson should call me
“green,” and yet be in earnest with such absurdity as this;
which I recommended him (since he had such faith in it) to
learn by heart, and then repeat, with the needful alterations,
to the gentleman whose daughter he was anxious now to win.
However, though indignant and frightened sadly at the news
about that vile baronet, I was pleased on the whole with Sam’s
behaviour, though not with his last words; which were these,
as he left me at the top of the village, and he uttered them with
much solemnity—“I say, who stole the dog? Talk of angels,
after that!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>TRUE LOVE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> any one had told me, so lately as last week, that Sam and
myself would be sworn allies upon matters of the deepest
interest, within fifty years of such a prophecy, I should have
considered him as great a liar as the greatest statesman of the
present period prove themselves daily out of their own mouths.
Although I had not then the benefit of knowing how the
most righteous of mankind deceive us, I knew well enough
that the world is full of rogues, for no man can visit Covent
Garden twice without having that conviction forced upon him.
And Sam Henderson’s quiet grins at my “greenness” naturally
led me to ponder just a little upon the possibility of his
trafficking upon it. However, I am glad to say, and still hold
to it, that neither then, nor even in my later troubles, which
were infinitely deeper than any yet recounted, did I ever
pass into the bitter shadow through which all men are beheld
as liars.</p>

<p>The difficulty was to know what to do next. If I did
nothing, which was the easiest thing to do—and a course to
which my bashfulness and ignorance inclined me—the foulest
of all foul wrongs might triumph; the sweetest and most
lovable of all the fair beings, who are sent among the coarser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
lot to renew their faith in goodness, might even by virtue of
her own excellence become a sacrifice to villainy. I knew that
my darling had that strong sense of justice, without which
pure gentleness is as a broken reed; and I felt that she also
had a keen perception of the good and the bad, as they
appear in men. But, alas! I knew also that she loved her
father before any one on earth, and almost worshipped him,
which he deserved for his character at large, but not so
entirely for his conduct to herself. He was always kind and
loving to her when the state of things permitted it; but the
bent of his nature was towards peace, and in the strange
home, which had swallowed him, there was no peace, either
by day or night, if he even dared to show that he loved his
own child. The blackest falsehoods were told about her, and the
lowest devices perpetually plied—as I discovered later on—to
estrange the father from the daughter, and rob them of
their faith in one another. But this part of her story I mean
to pass over with as light a step as possible, for to dwell on
such matters stirs the lower part of nature, and angers us
without the enlargement of good wrath. We must try to
forgive, when we cannot forget, and endeavour not to hope—whenever
faith allows us—that the cruel and inhuman may
be basted with red pepper for more than a millennium of the
time to come.</p>

<p>But as yet I had none of this clemency in me. Youth has
a stronger and far more militant sense of justice than middle
age. I was fired continually with indignation, and often
clenched my fists, and was eager to rush at a wall with no
door in it, when my uncle’s tale and Sam’s confirmation came
into my head like a whirlwind. “What a fool I am, what a
helpless idiot!” I kept on muttering to myself; “the murder
will be done before I move.”</p>

<p>I could see no pretext, no prospect whatever, no possibility
of interference; and my uncle (to whom I confided my misery)
could only shake his head, and say—“Very bad job, my boy.
You must try to make the best of it.”</p>

<p>Probably it would have made the worst of me, and left me
to die an old bachelor, if it had not been for a little chance,
such as no one would think much of. Time was drawing on,
without a sign of sunshine in it; when to pick up a very small
crumb of comfort, and recall the happiest day I had ever known
yet, I went to my cupboard, and pulled out a simple sketch in
water colours, which I had made of the stricken pear-tree;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
after some one had made of it the luckiest tree that ever died.
She had not finished her work of art, partly through sweet talk
with me; and I hoped to surprise her and compare our portraits,
when she should come to complete her drawing. Now as I
glanced, and sighed, and gazed, and put in a little touch with
listless hands, my good genius stood behind me, in the form of
a little old woman, holding in one hand a bucket, and in the
other a scrubbing-brush.</p>

<p>“Lor’, how bootiful ’e have dooed ’un!” Tabby Tapscott
cried, as if she would like to have a turn at it with her reeking
brush. “A can zee every crinkle crankum of they leaveses,
and a girt bumble-drum coom to sniff at ’un. Her cudn’t do
’un half so natteral as thiccy, if her was to coom a dizen taimes,
for kissy-kissy talk like. Think I didn’t clap eyes upon ’e
both? Good as a plai it wor, and the both of ’e vancying nobbody
naigh! Lor’, I niver zee nort more amoosin!”</p>

<p>“Then all I can say is, you ought to have that bucket of
slops thrown over you. What business of yours, you inquisitive
old creature?”</p>

<p>“That be vaine manners after arl as I dooed, to vetch ’un
here for you to carr’ on with! Ha, ha, ha, I cud tell ’e
zummat now, if so be I was mainded to. But I reckon ’e wud
goo to drow boocket auver Tabby?”</p>

<p>This renewed my courtesy at once, for I had great faith in
Tabby’s devices; and after some coying, and the touch of a
crooked sixpence, she told me her plan, which was simplicity
itself, so that I wondered at my own dulness. I was to find
out where Captain Fairthorn lived, which could be done with
the greatest ease; and then to call and make a point of seeing
him, on the plea of presenting him with a perfect copy, such as his
daughter had no time to finish. Who could tell that good luck
might not afford me a glimpse at, or even a few words with,
the one who was never absent from my mind? And supposing
there were no such bliss as that, at least I could get some tidings
of her, and possibly find a chance of doing something more.
Be it as it might, I could make things no worse; and anything
was better than this horrible suspense. I consulted my uncle
about this little scheme, and he readily fell in with it; for he
could not bear to see me going about my work as if my heart
were not in it, and searching the papers in dread of bad news
every morning. And finding that I could be of use to him in
London, he proposed that I should go that very night in the
fruit-van, with Selsey Bill, and the thief-boy—that is to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the boy who kept watch against thieves, of whom there are
scores in the market.</p>

<p>When I found my way, towards the middle of the day, to
that wild weald—as it then was—of London, which is now a
camp of Punch-and-Judy boxes strung with balconies, it took
me some minutes to become convinced that I was not in a hop-ground
turned upside down. Some mighty contractor was at
work in a breadth and depth of chaos; and countless volcanoes
of piled clay, which none but a demon could have made to
burn, were uttering horizontal fumes, not at all like honest
smoke in texture, but tenfold worse to cope with. Some
thousands of brawny navvies, running on planks (at the head
pirate’s order) with skeleton barrows before them, had contrived
(with the aid of ten thousand tin pots) to keep their throats
clear and their insides going. Not one of them would stop to
tell me where I was; all gave a nod and went on barrowing;
perhaps they were under conditions, such as occur to most of us
in the barrow-drive of life, when to pause for a moment is to
topple over.</p>

<p>After shouting in vain to these night-capped fellows, I saw
through the blue mist of drifting poison, a young fellow,
perhaps about twenty-one, who seemed to be clerk of the works,
or something; and I felt myself fit to patronize him, being four
or five years his elder, and at least to that amount his bigger.
But for his better he would not have me, and snapped in such
a style that I seemed to belong almost to a past generation.
“Fairthorn?” he said. “Yes, I may have heard of him.
Elderly gent—wears goggles, and goes in for thunderbolts.
Don’t hang out here, stops business. Three turns to the left,
and ask the old applewoman.”</p>

<p>I was much inclined to increase his acquaintance with
apples, by giving him one to his eye—external, and not a
treasure; but before I could even return his contempt, he was
gone, and left me in the wilderness. At last I found a boy
who was looking after pots, and for twopence he not only led
me truly, but enlightened me largely as to this part of the
world. He showed me where the “Great Shebissun” was to
be, and how all the roads were to be laid out, and even shook
his head (now twelve years old) as to the solvency of this “rum
rig.” He dismissed me kindly—with his salary doubled—at
the gate of the great philosopher; and with his finger to his
nose gave parting counsel.</p>

<p>“Best not go in, young man. The old codger can blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
you to bits, by turning a handle, and the old cat’ll scratch
your wig off. But there’s a stunnin’ gal—ah, that’s what
you’re after! I say, young covey, if you’re game for a bit of
sweet’artin’ on the sly, I’ll show yer the very nick for it.” He
pointed to a gate between two old trees, and overhung with
ivy. “How does I know?” he said, anticipating briskly
any doubt on my part; “s’help me taters, it’s the only place
round here as I never took a pot of beer to.”</p>

<p>Anxious as I was, I smiled a little at this criterion of a
trysting-place, and then did my utmost to fix in mind the
bearings of this strange neighbourhood. Although I knew the
busy parts of London well enough, of the vast spread of out-skirts
I knew little, except the ups and downs of the great
roads through them, and here and there a long look-out from
the top of Notting Hill, or any other little eminence. Even so
I had only lost my eyes in a mighty maze of things to come,
and felt a deep wonder of pity for the builders, who were
running up houses they could never fill. The part I was now
exploring lay between the two great western roads, and was
therefore to me an unknown land. But I felt pretty sure that
the house now before me had been quite lately a mere country
mansion, with grounds not overlooked, and even meadows of
its own, where cows might find it needful to low to one another,
and a horse might go a long way to find a gate to scratch
against.</p>

<p>Even now there was a cattle-pond (the dregs of better days)
near the gate that led up from the brickfields; and half a dozen
ancient Scotch firs leaned in a whispering attitude towards one
another; perhaps they alone were left of a goodly group,
trembling at every axe that passed. The house itself was
long, low, and red, and full of little windows, upon whose sills
a straggling ilex leaned its elbows here and there, and sparrows
held a lively chivvy. There was not a flower in the beds in
front, and the box-edging of the walks was as high and broad
as a wheel-barrow. Two large cedars, one at either corner of
the sodden grass-plot, looked like mighty pencils placed to
mark the extent of the building.</p>

<p>Descrying no one (except an ancient dog of mighty stature,
and of some race unknown to me, who came up in a friendly
manner) I summoned all my courage, with good manners at the
back of it, and pulled a great bell-handle hanging, like a
butcher’s steelyard, between two mossy piers of stone. There
was no sound of any bell inside, and I was counting the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for another pull, when the door was opened some few inches,
and sharp black eyes peered out at me.</p>

<p>“Subscription Bible? No, thank you, young man. Cook
was put into County-court last time.”</p>

<p>I did not know what she meant, until I saw that she was
glancing at the poor portfolio, of my own make, which held my
unpretentious drawing. “I am not come for any subscription,”
I said, drawing back from the door, as she seemed to
suspect that I would try to push it open. “I have the
pleasure of knowing Captain Fairthorn, and I wish to see
him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think you can,” she answered sharply; “but if
you will tell me what your business is, I will ask the Mistress
about it. You may come, and wait here, while I go to her.
Scrape your boots first, and don’t bring in any clay.”</p>

<p>This did not sound very gracious; but I obeyed her orders
with my best smile, and producing two very fine pears, laid
them on the black marble chimney-piece of the hall. Her
sallow face almost relaxed to a smile.</p>

<p>“Young man from the country? Well, take a chair a
minute, while I go and ask for orders about you.” With
these words she hastened up an old oak staircase, and left me
at leisure to look about.</p>

<p>The hall was a large but not lofty chamber, panelled with
some dark wood, and hung with several grimy paintings. Two
doors at either end led from it, as well as the main staircase in
the middle, and a narrow stone passage at one corner. The
fireplace was large, but looked as if it had more to do with frost
than fire; and the day being chilly and very damp, with an
east wind crawling along the ground, I began to shiver, for my
feet were wet from the wilderness of clay I had waded through.
But presently the sound of loud voices caught my ear, and
filled me with hot interest.</p>

<p>One of the doors at the further end was not quite closed,
and the room beyond resounded with some contention. “What
a fool you are to make such a fuss!” one feminine voice was
exclaiming—“Oh, don’t reason with her,” cried another, “the
poor stupe isn’t worth it. The thing is settled, and so what
is the use of talking? How glad I shall be to see the last of
her wicked temper and perpetual sulks. And I am sure you
will be the same, Jerry. Nothing surprises me so much as
Mamma’s wonderful patience with her. Why, she hasn’t
boxed her ears since Saturday!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t only that,” replied the first; “but, Frizzy, consider
the indulgences she has had. A candle to go to bed with,
almost every night, and a sardine, positively one of our sardines,
for her dinner, the day before yesterday. Why, she’ll want to
be dining with us, the next thing! The more she is petted,
the worse she gets. Now don’t you aspire to dine with us,
you dear, you darling, don’t you now?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I never do,” replied a gentle voice, silvery even
now, though quivering with tears; “I would rather have
bread and water by myself in peace, than be scolded, and
sneered at, and grudged every mouthful. Oh, what have I
done to deserve it all?”</p>

<p>“I told you what would come of reasoning with her,” said
the one who had been called “Frizzy”—probably Miss
Euphrasia Bulwrag; “it simply makes her outrageous, Jerry.
Ever since she came back from Sunbury, there has simply
been no living with her. And she looks upon us as her
enemies, because we are resolved that she shall do what is
best for her. Lady Hotchpot—what can sound better? And
then she can eat and drink all day long, which seems to be all
she cares for.”</p>

<p>“That’s a little mistake of yours,” answered Miss Jerry, or
Geraldine; “I know her tricks even better than you do. She
cares for something, or somebody, some clodhopper, or chawbacon,
down in that delightful village. Why, you can’t say
‘Sunbury,’ in the most innocent manner, without her blushing
furiously. But she’s so cunning—I can’t get out of her who
the beloved chawbacon is. Come now, Kitty, make a clean
breast of it. I believe it’s the fellow that bets down there,
and lives by having families of horses. Sir Cumberleigh told
me all about him, and had a rare laugh; you should have seen
him laugh, when I said that our Kitty was smitten. Well, I
hoped she had a little more principle than that. And you’d
think that butter wouldn’t melt in her mouth!”</p>

<p>“Butter never gets a chance”—I heard my darling say, and
knew by her voice that the sweetest temper in the world was
roused at last—“your mother never lets it go into my mouth;
while you have it thicker than your bread almost. But I’ll
thank you to enjoy among yourselves, or with any old rake you
may fawn upon, your low and most ignorant gossip about me.
You had better not strike me. Your mother may. But I will
not take it from either of you; nor from both together.”</p>

<p>I could scarcely contain myself, I assure you; and if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
young tyrants had fallen upon her, I must have got into a nice
position—in the old, but not in the new sense of “nice”—that
of bodily conflict with women. Luckily, however, these
were cowards, as behoved such creatures; and I verily believe
that my angel (if driven—as no angel should be—into a free
fight) would have made a bad record of both of them.</p>

<p>I was hovering, as it were, upon my legs, burning to dash
into the room, yet shuddering at the strange intrusion, when
Miss Fairthorn came out very quietly, and holding her handkerchief
to her streaming eyes. The door was banged behind
her, as if by a kick, and a loud contemptuous laugh came
through it. What I did is a great deal more than I can tell;
for I must have been carried far beyond myself, by pity,
indignation, and ardent love.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” said Kitty, as I stood before her, almost
before she could have used her eyes, being overcome with
weeping; but the glance she gave me had told the thing that
I cared for most in earth or heaven. And the strangest point
was that we felt no surprise at being together in this wondrous
way. To me it seemed right that she should fall into my
arms; and to her it seemed natural that I should drop from
heaven. “Oh, don’t!” said Kitty, but she let me do it.</p>

<p>I kissed away her tears, and I cannot tell you whether
they gave me more bliss or pain; I stroked her softly nestling
hair, as if it all belonged to me; and I played with her pretty
fingers, putting them one by one between my great things, to
make the thrilling process last. Then I looked once more into
her lovely eyes—the wells of all my life-springs now—and lo,
their tears were flown; and hope, and woman’s faith, and
heaven’s own love, were beaming from their lustrous depth, as
the light that proves the jewel true!</p>

<p>“Darling of my life,” was all I said; and she only
answered—</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>TRUE FATHER.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> anybody may suppose, who looks at things too sensibly,
that true love never yet has chosen time and place more
foolishly, for coming to grand issue, and obtaining pledge for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
ever. The sour-faced woman might have returned in the crisis
of our doings, or the two young tyrants might have broken
forth, and made sport of us from the parlour. Whether we
knew these things or not, we never gave a thought to them;
all we thought of was one another, and the rest might think
what they liked of us. This is not a large way to look at
things; and yet once in a life, the largest.</p>

<p>My Kitty—as I called her now, and have never since wanted
any other name—was the first (as behoved the more sensitive
one) to bring common sense to bear on us.</p>

<p>“You must come and see my father, dear,” she whispered,
with her hands in mine; “I am sure that he loves me all he
can. And if you have quite made up your mind that you
cannot do without me, we may trust him to make the best of
it; for he always makes the best of things.”</p>

<p>“Show me where he is,” I answered, scarcely yet believing
that my fortune was so glorious; while she looked at me as only
one in the world can ever look at us; “I fear that he will be
sadly vexed; but he is kind to every one.”</p>

<p>“He will not be vexed on his own account, nor yet on mine,”
she answered very quietly; “but nobody knows what he has
to bear. Let us go to him, while he is by himself. There is some
one coming; we must be quick.”</p>

<p>We hastened down the long stone passage, just in time to
escape the servant, who at last had found her mistress; and
after passing several doors, we came to one with an iron bar,
and iron rails, in front of it.</p>

<p>“See how he has to protect himself! If somebody knew
that I have this key, it would very soon be torn from me. I
dare say you are surprised; such things are not done down at
Sunbury. How I love that quiet place!”</p>

<p>“And you shall live there all your life,” I answered, as we
passed the barrier; “no one shall dare to insult you there; you
shall be the Queen, the Queen of all; and you know who will
be your slave of slaves.”</p>

<p>“That is all very fine talk,” she said; “I believe it is the
usual style at first; and then we come to Bramah locks, and cold
iron.”</p>

<p>But her smile, as she put her hand on my shoulder, proved
that her own heart taught her better.</p>

<p>“Let me go in first, and see what he is doing. Oh, Kit,
you have taken advantage enough. What right have you to
say that it is your last chance? I am sure I hope not. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
how mean of you to turn my own words against me! Now
have a little reason. Yes, yes, yes. For the fiftieth time at
least, in five minutes—I love you, and never will have anybody
else. Now let me go in first; sometimes he is too busy for
even me to interrupt him.”</p>

<p>Much against my will, I let her go, for half an hour later
would have done as well according to my judgment; and after
securing the fence behind us, which had wholly escaped my
attention, she knocked at the door of the inner room, and
without being answered opened it.</p>

<p>Her father was sitting with his back to us, so intent upon
some small object that he did not hear our footsteps. Some
instrument made of brass and glass, but quite unlike a microscope,
was in his left hand, and with the other he was slowly
revolving something. The appearance of the room amazed me,
with its vast multitude of things unknown to me even by name
or shape, but all looking full of polished mischief and poisonous
intelligence.</p>

<p>“This is why my Kitty weeps, and is starved and crushed
by female dragons,” I said to myself in bitter mood; and even
the Professor’s grand calm head, and sweet scientific attitude, did
not arouse the reverence which a stranger would have felt for
him.</p>

<p>His daughter touched, as lightly as a frond of fern might
touch it, one of his wavering silver locks, and waited with a
smile for him to turn. But I saw that her bosom trembled,
with a sigh of deeper birth than smiles. Then he turned and
looked at her, and knew from the eyes, that were so like his
own, and yet so deeply different, that she had something he
must hear.</p>

<p>“You have been crying again, my child,” he said as he
kissed her forehead; “they promised me you should be happy
now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I let them do what they like. Father, you have
no idea what it is. I am never allowed to see you alone,
except by stealth, and at fearful risk. Father, come out of
philosophy and science, and attend to your own child.”</p>

<p>“But my dear, I do. It is the very thing that is in my
mind continually. I spoke very strongly not a week ago, and
received a solemn promise that you should have new clothes,
and diet the same as the rest, and everything I could think of
for your good.”</p>

<p>“How many times have they promised it, father? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
then I am beaten and put on bread and water, for having dared
to complain to you. But all that is a trifle, a thing soon over.
I must expect that sort of thing, because I have no mother.
But, father, what they are trying to do to me is ten times worse
than ragged clothes, or starvation, or bodily punishment. They
want me to marry a man I detest—an old man, and a bad
one!”</p>

<p>“My dear, I have promised you, and you know that you can
rely on my promises, that you shall not even be allowed to
marry a man of doubtful character. I have not been able, my
darling Kitty, to do everything I should have liked for you;
but one thing is certain—if inquiries prove that this gentleman—I
forget his name—is a man of bad life and unkind nature,
you shall have nothing to do with him. You know how little
I am able now to go into what is called ‘Society,’ and most of
my friends are men of my own tastes. But I have taken
particular trouble, at the loss of much important time, to
ascertain whether your opinion of this person is correct. He is
wealthy and of good family, I am told, though that is merely a
secondary point. He is likely to have outlived youthful follies;
and the difference of age is in your favour.”</p>

<p>“But not in his”—interrupted Kitty, with a smile, for which
I could have kissed her fifty times, it was so natural, and simple,
yet sagacious.</p>

<p>“You are flippant, my dear, in spite of all your troubles,”
continued her father, smiling also. “No length of discipline
has entirely tamed you. And now I will tell you why I am
so anxious that you should have a settled home, and some one
to take care of you, as soon as can suitably be arranged. I am
likely to leave England, on a roving expedition, for how long a
time is as yet uncertain. It may be for a twelvemonth, or even
more, possibly for two years; and all that time, where will you
be, my darling child? I know that you are not happy now;
though my object in making this second arrangement was
mainly to have you protected and cared for. But things have
not turned out exactly as I hoped; and I fear that in my
absence they may grow still worse. When I heard that this
gentleman was strongly attached to you, and wished you to become
his wife this winter, I hoped that I might be of some
little service to the cause of knowledge, without any neglect of
my duty to you. And I may tell you, my child, that through a
long course of rather extravagant habits, which I have failed to
check, it is become of great importance to me, so far as mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
money goes—which is not much—to accept the appointment
which is offered me. I am often deeply grieved at your condition,
and do my very utmost to improve it; but am not
always allowed; as you know, my dear, and are very sweet and
patient with me—I am not always allowed to have my own
way.”</p>

<p>“Don’t put it so, papa. That is not half the truth. Say
that you never have been allowed, never are, and never will be,
to have so much as a barleycorn of your own way.”</p>

<p>“Young people put things in too strong a light,” the man
of science answered gently. “But we will not go into that
question now. Only you will see, my dear, from what I have
said, why I am so anxious that you should be settled in a happy
and peaceful home of your own, far away from all those who
worry you. This gentleman offers you a wealthy home; but
knowing your nature, I do not insist on that. Indeed I should
be quite satisfied with a very humble home for my darling, if
it were a happy one.”</p>

<p>“Very well, papa, nothing could be nicer. I can please you
now exactly, and meet all your wishes, though I cannot bear to
hear of your leaving me so long. But you will not leave me to
the tender mercies”—here my Kitty beckoned to me to come
forward, which I had long been most eager to do, but in
obedience to her signals, had remained by the door and behind
a tall case of some wheel within wheel-work, almost as complex
as human motives—“father, you see that you need not leave me
to the tender mercies of anybody, except this gentleman, who
saved my life at Sunbury, as you know, and wishes to make it
a part of his own, for the rest of it.”</p>

<p>Captain Fairthorn looked at me with extreme surprise; my
idea of his character was that nothing upon or below the
earth could surprise him. But he had his glasses on; and
these always seem to me to treble the marks of astonishment in
the eyes that stand behind them. In deference to his large
intellect, and fame, and great (though inactive) nobility of
nature, I waited for him to begin, though I am sure—now I
come to think of it—that he would have been glad for me to
take the move.</p>

<p>“Kitty,” he said at last, with some relief at not having to
fall upon me yet, “I should like to know a little more of this
story. I remember this young man very well. But his name
has escaped me for the moment. He will not think me rude.
It is one of the many penalties we pay for undue devotion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
our own little subjects. If he had been a zoophyte, or a proboscidian,
or even one of the constituents—”</p>

<p>“If he had been a zoophyte, papa, or anything else with a
very big name, and a very little meaning,” Miss Fairthorn
exclaimed in reproachful tones, “where should I be now? At
the bottom of the Thames. And perhaps you would enjoy
dredging for me.”</p>

<p>“In spite of all training, she has a temper;” the father
addressed this remark to me. “Also she has a deep sense of
gratitude—a feeling we find the more largely developed, the
further we travel from the human order. But, my dear, you
allow yourself vague discursions. In a matter like this you
have brought before me, my desire is always to be practical.
That great and original investigator, to whom we owe not only
knowledge, but what is even more important, the only true
course, by which to arrive—”</p>

<p>“My dear father, if you once begin on that—the knowledge
we want, and a quick course to it, is whether you will be so
good and so kind, as to make us both happy by your consent.
This gentleman loves me; and I love him. He is not wealthy;
but he is good. You may leave me in his care, without a
doubt. I have not known him long; but I know him as truly
as if we had been brought up together. The only fault he has
is that he cannot praise himself. And his reverence for you is
so strong and deep, that it makes him more diffident than ever.
You are dreadfully diffident yourself, papa, you know you are;
and that makes me so despise all boastful people. Now fully
understand that I won’t have that horrible old Sir Cumbrous
Hotchpot, and I will have this Kit Orchardson; that is to say,
with your leave, father. And you owe me something, I should
think, after all—but I have no right to speak of that. Only, if
you don’t give it, mind, I’ll—I’ll—” As a sample of what
she would do, she began to sob deeply; and I caught her in my
arms.</p>

<p>“You see, sir,” I said—“oh, don’t, my darling; your father
is the kindest man in the world, and he will never have the
heart to make you unhappy—you see, sir, how good she is, and
how simple, and ready to be satisfied even with me. I am a
poor man, and I have my way to make; but with her I could
make it to—to—” I was going to say “heaven,” but substituted,
“the top of the tree. And we have a pretty place,
where she would be happy as the day is long. And if I don’t
protect her, and cherish her, and worship her, and keep her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the apple of my eye, I hope you will take me by the neck,
Captain Fairthorn, and put me under this air-pump.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that is an air-pump?” he asked, with
admiration of my cleverness.</p>

<p>“By the look, sir,” I replied; “I have seen them before.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, it isn’t; neither does it much resemble one.
Kitty, you see what his diffidence is; and another proof, I
suppose, is, that he has fallen in love with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said my darling, with a smile so humble, and loving,
and confiding, that my eyes grew moist, and her father could
not see through his spectacles; “it is a sure proof of his diffidence;
for he deserves to have a better wife than I shall ever
be; although I will do my best to please him.”</p>

<p>“Well, after that,” replied Captain Fairthorn, “it seems to
me, that my opinion matters very little. You appear to have
made up your minds; and your minds appear to have been made
for one another. I am wholly unable to withstand such facts.
Of course I shall make my inquiries, Master Kit. But so far
as I can see at present, I will not deny you what you have won.
If she is half as good to her husband as she always has been to
her father, you will be a happy man, God willing. There
kiss me, my pretty dear, and don’t cry any more, till he
makes you.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>FALSE MOTHER.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Such</span> is the balance of human events—if the phrase be held
admissible—that the moment any member of our race is likely
to strike the stars with his head sublime, he receives a hard
thump upon that protuberance, and comes down with a crown—but
a cracked one. As for myself—an unpretentious fellow,
and of very simple intellect, though not quite such a fool as
the world considered me in my later troubles,—desiring always
to tell the truth, I will not deny that I walked on air, when I
found myself gifted with my Kitty’s love, and her large-hearted
father’s assent to it. It had been arranged that I must wait,
and keep my bliss inside my waistcoat, until such time as slower
prudence and clearer foresight might prescribe. But all I
thought of were the glorious facts that Kitty loved me as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
loved her, and that her father, who alone could enter sound
denial, would not deny. “What do I care for that old stepmother?”
I said to myself, as I buttoned my coat.</p>

<p>That coat was henceforth sacred to me. There may have
been smarter and grander coats, coats with more tone of high
art about them, and of sleeker and richer substance. But this
coat was enriched for ever with at least three tears from Kitty’s
eyes, Kitty’s lovely hair had fallen like a vernal shower upon
it, and her true heart had quivered to it, when she owned whose
heart it was. I knew that it might be my duty now to start a
new coat of loftier order, to keep me abreast of my rise
in the world, as the son of a celebrated man; nevertheless this
would be the coat to look back upon and look up to, as it hung
upon a holy peg, with the pockets full of lavender.</p>

<p>I had said farewell to my dear love, and was just beginning
to think how I would come it over Uncle Corny, telling him a
bit, and then another bit, and leading him on to laugh at me,
until I should come out with news which would make him snap
his favourite pipe—when suddenly, near the Captain’s gate, I
felt a sharp tug from behind. The dusk was gathering, and I
meant to put my best foot foremost, and walk all the way to Sunbury,
scarcely feeling the road beneath my feet.</p>

<p>“What do you want, little chap?” I asked, for it was not
in my power then to speak rudely to any living creature,
although I was vexed at losing time.</p>

<p>“If you please, young man, my lady says that you are to come
back and speak to her. You are to come with me to the door
over there. And you must be careful how you scrape your boots.”</p>

<p>I looked at the boy, and felt inclined to laugh. He was
dressed in green from head to foot, and two or three dozen gilt
buttons shone in a double row down the front of him. For a
moment I doubted about obeying, until it occurred to me that
if I refused, my sin might be visited upon another. So I
turned and followed the page, who seemed to think disobedience
impossible. He led me to a door at the west end of the
house, and then up a little staircase to a fine broad passage,
with statues and pictures looking very grand indeed. Before I
could take half of it into my mind, he opened a door with
carved work upon it, and showed me into the grandest room I
had ever entered, except in show places, such as Hampton
Court, or Windsor Castle. All this part of the house was so
different from the other end that I was amazed, when I came
to think of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>But I could not think now of floors and ceilings, or even
chairs and tables, as I walked with my best hat in my hand,
towards a tall lady very richly dressed, who stood by the
mantelpiece, almost like a figure carved upon it. Her thick
and strong hair seemed as black as a coal, until one came to
look into it; and then it showed an undercast of red, such as I
never saw in any other person. Her form was large and robust
and full, and as powerful as that of any ordinary man; but the
chief thing to notice was her face and eyes. Her face was like
those we see cut in shell, to represent some ancient goddess,
such as I read of at Hampton School—Juno, or Pallas, or it
may have been Proserpine, my memory is not clear upon those
little points—but although I remember a god with two faces,
and a dog with three heads, I cannot call to mind any goddess
among them endowed with three chins. “My lady,” as the
boy in green had called her, certainly did own three fine chins,
as well as a mouth which was too large for the shells, and
contemptuous nostrils that seemed to sift the air, and bright
eyes with very thick lids for their sheath—and they wanted a
sheath, I can tell you—and a forehead which looked as if it
could roll, instead of only wrinkling, when the storm of passion
swept it.</p>

<p>As yet I was too young to understand that justice and
kindness are the only qualities entitling our poor fellow-mortals
to respect. I had passed through no tribulation yet, and coped
with none of the sorrows, which enlarge, when they do not
embitter, the heart. Therefore I was much impressed by this
lady’s grandeur and fine presence, and made her a clumsy bow,
as if I had scarcely a right to exist before her. She saw it,
and scorned me, and took the wrong course, as we mostly do
when we despise another.</p>

<p>“Do I know your name, young man?” she asked, as if it
were very doubtful whether I possessed any name at all. “I
seem to have heard of you, but cannot say where.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” I said, with my spirit returning at the
insolent disdain of her eyes and voice, “the boy who came
to fetch me has made some mistake. No doubt you wished
to see some other person. I beg you to make no apologies.”</p>

<p>With another low bow, I began my retreat, and was very
near securing it; for she became too furious to condescend to
speak. But two young ladies, whom I had scarcely noticed,
jumped up from their chairs, and intercepted me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mamma forgets names so,” said one of them, a little plain
thing with a mass of curly hair; “but you are Mr. Orchardson,
I think, of Sunbury. If so, it is you that mamma wants to
speak to.”</p>

<p>“I am not Mr. Orchardson of Sunbury,” I answered; “my
Uncle Cornelius is the gentleman so known. I am Christopher
Orchardson, who only helps him in his business.”</p>

<p>“Then, Christopher Orchardson,” resumed their mother, as
I came back and looked at her quietly, “you seem to have very
little knowledge of good manners. Allow me to ask you what
you are doing in this house?”</p>

<p>“I understood that I was sent for, ma’am; and I am waiting
to know what your pleasure is.” I saw the girls giggle, and
glance at one another, as I delivered this statement.</p>

<p>“None of your trifling with me, young man. What I
insist upon knowing is this. What right had you to enter my
house, some hours ago, without my knowledge, and to remain
in it, without my permission? Don’t fence with the question,
but answer it.”</p>

<p>“That is easy enough,” I replied with my eyes full on hers,
which vainly strove to look down mine; “I came to this house,
without asking whose it was, to see Captain Fairthorn, with a
little sketch of something in which he had taken interest.
The servant, or housekeeper, told me to wait, while she went to
look for her mistress. Then I met Miss Fairthorn, whom I
have had the pleasure of meeting several times before; and she
most kindly showed me to her father’s room. And I was very
glad to find him in good health. After a very pleasant time
with him, I was leaving the garden on my way home, when I
was told that you wished to see me. I was not rude enough to
refuse, and that is why I am in this house again.”</p>

<p>“You have made a fine tale of it, but not told the truth.
Did you come to my house to see the Professor? Or did you
come rather to see his daughter?”</p>

<p>“I came to this house to see Captain Fairthorn. But I
hoped that I might perhaps have the pleasure of seeing Miss
Fairthorn also.”</p>

<p>“And what was your motive in wishing to see her? I have
a right to ask, as she is in my charge. I stand in the place of
a mother to her, whether she is grateful, or whether she is
otherwise. What did you wish to see her for?”</p>

<p>I was greatly at a loss to answer this. Not from any shame
at the affection, which was the honour and glory of my being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
but from dread of the consequences to my precious darling.
She saw my hesitation, and burst forth,—</p>

<p>“Do you think that I do not know all about it? You have
had the gross insolence to lift your eyes to a young lady far
above you in every way. You fancy that because she has no
mother, and her father is a man of no worldly wisdom, and of
extravagant sentiments, a kind of philosopher in short, you will
be permitted to reduce her to your inferior rank in life. What
are you?—a small market-gardener, or something of that kind,
I believe.”</p>

<p>“You were kind enough to say just now,” I answered,
“that you did not know anything about me. Even my name
was strange to you. I am not ashamed of my business; and I
lay no traps for any one.”</p>

<p>“Have you the insolence to refer to me?” Her guilty
conscience caught her here, and under its sting she grew so
wild that I thought she would have flown at me, though no
thought of her had been in my words. “But you are below
my contempt, and I wonder that I even deign to speak to you.
And I will make short work of it. Go back to your spade, or
your heap of manure, or whatever it is you live in, and never
dare to think again of Miss Kitty Fairthorn. She is engaged
to a gentleman of family, and title, and large property; and I
mean to have her married to him very shortly. Go back to
your manure-heap; I have done with you.”</p>

<p>“Not quite so easily as you think.” To her great amazement
I approached her, not only without terror, but with calm
contempt. “You have a foul scheme in hand, as is widely
known, for selling a poor girl, whom you have vilely misused,
and starved for some years, and made her life a misery; and
you think you will be allowed to sell her to a reprobate old
man, who has not even gold enough to cover the blackness of
his character. As a girl she has borne your blows, as a woman
she would have to bear those of a cowardly and godless scoundrel.
You like plain speaking, and there it is for you. Do you
think that God will allow such crimes? I tell you, poor tyrant,
that the right will conquer. Miss Fairthorn shall have a
happy home, with the affection and kindness of which you
have robbed her; and you—you shall suffer the misery you
have inflicted.”</p>

<p>Now I had not meant to say a single word of this, and was
thoroughly astonished at my own strong language. Bitterly
angry with myself as well, for what I felt to be unmanly conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
(even under fiercest provocation), when I saw the effect
upon this haughty lady. It must have been many years now,
since any one had dared to show her thus what she was like;
for her strong will had swept black and white into one—the
one she chose to make of them. Weak indolence, and cowardice,
a thousandfold more common than the resolute will, had got
out of her way, until her way turned to a resistless rush.</p>

<p>She looked at me now, as if utterly unable to believe that
her ears could be true to her. Then glancing at one of her
daughters, she said, “Geraldine, this young man does not
mean it. He has no idea what he is talking about. Take him
away, my dear; I feel unwell. I shall be able to think of
things, by-and-by. Euphrasia, run for the sal volatile, or the
Cognac in the square decanter. And then he may come back,
and tell me what he means.”</p>

<p>This strange turn of mind puzzled me, as much as my
straightforward speech had puzzled her. Dr. Sippets—our
great man at Sunbury—said, when I spoke of it many years
afterwards, that he quite understood, and could easily explain
it. To wit, that with people of choleric habit, the vessels of
the brain become so charged up to a certain tension, that if
anything more—but I had better not try to put his hundred-tun
words into my pint pot. He is a choleric man himself; and
his vessels might become so charged as to vent themselves in a
heavy charge to me. It is enough to say, that when the lady
sank, with a face as white as death, upon the sofa, proper
feeling told me to depart.</p>

<p>This I was doing, in a sad haze of mind; doubting whether
duty did not require that I should halt on the premises, until
I had learned how the sufferer passed through her trial. But
now another strange thing happened to me, and perhaps the
very last I should have dreamed of. I was lingering uneasily
near the door, with many pricks of self-reproach and even
shame, when a slim figure glided out and came to me. Although
the night had quite fallen now, I could see that it was
not my Kitty who came out, but some one much shorter, and
smaller altogether. With great anxiety I went to meet her,
fearing almost to hear fatal tidings; for who can tell in such
a case what may be the end of it?</p>

<p>“You need not be alarmed, Mr. Orchardson,” said a voice
which I recognized as that of Miss Jerry; “my mother is all
right again, and quite ready to have another turn at you, if you
are anxious to come back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Lord forbid!” I replied devoutly. “I would run
into the hottest of the brick-kilns yonder, rather than meet the
good lady again. But I am delighted that it is no worse. It
was very kind of you to come and tell me. My best thanks to
you, Miss Geraldine.”</p>

<p>“It was not that at all,” she said with some hesitation;
“I did not come to set your mind at ease, though I thought
that possibly you might be waiting here; which is very good
of you. But I came to say how grateful I am for your behaviour.
You have done a lot of good; I cannot tell you half
of it. Nobody ever dares to contradict mamma; that is what
makes her so much what she is. She is very kind and pleasant
at the bottom, I am sure. But she has such a very strong will
of her own; as a clever man said, when he tried to comfort my
dear father many years ago, such a ‘very powerful identity,’
that every one has always given way before her, until she—until
she thinks all the world is bound to do it. You spoke
very harshly to her, I know. Perhaps a real gentleman would
not have done it; and for the moment I hated you. But she
is so delightful to us ever since! We shall have a sweet time
of it, for at least a week. But won’t Miss Kitty catch it?”</p>

<p>Those last words gave me a bitter pang. This odd girl, who
seemed to have some good in her, spoke them, as I thought,
with exultation, or at any rate without any sign of sorrow.
Her justice, like her mother’s, stopped at home.</p>

<p>“If I have done you any good,” I said, with faint hopes of
getting some little myself, “do promise me one thing; I am
sure you will. Try to be kind to Miss Fairthorn, and lighten
some little of the burden she has to bear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t know her,” she answered, with a laugh.
“You think she is wonderful, I dare say. I can tell you Miss
Kitty has a temper of her own. She is awfully provoking, and
she won’t be pitied. I believe she hates Frizzy and me, just
because we are our mother’s daughters. If you ever marry
her, you had better look out. However, I will bear with her,
as far as human nature can. And now I will say ‘Good-night.’”</p>

<p>She gave me her hand, which I did not expect; and I saw
that she was rather a pretty girl which I had not noticed in
the room. She had fine dark eyes, and her voice was much
softer than that of her sister; and, it seemed to me that she
might come to good, if she got among good people, and away
from her terrible mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>DOE DEM. ROE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> I gave Uncle Corny, as I was bound to do, a full
account of that day’s work, he was mightily pleased, and clapped
me on the back for having spoken so plainly to that haughty
woman.</p>

<p>“But now you must make up your mind,” he said, “to have
the door slammed in your face, if ever you attempt to get a
glimpse of your sweetheart there. Poor thing, what a time of
it she will have! What puts my back up is to think that her
own father lets her be knocked about like that. She never tells
him, you think, because it would only get him into trouble, and
do her no good. Well, she is a noble girl, if that is the case.
But he must know how she is treated, as I told you, in fifty
other ways,—badly dressed, half starved, or at any rate fed on
rice and suet-pudding, and kept in the schoolroom away from
the others. How was she dressed now? What clothes had she
on?”</p>

<p>I answered that I really did not know; and this was the
truth, though I blamed myself for it. When first she began to
be so much to me, I had noticed how neat and becoming her
cloak was, and her hat, and a little tender muff, which held a
still tenderer pair of hands. But now that she was all the
world to me, and more, I seemed to have no sense of her apparel,
but to be filled with herself alone, as if her existence came into
mine. I did not tell him that because he would have cried
“Stuff!”</p>

<p>But he understood my meaning, so far as to tell me of a
case he had known some years ago. A friend of his had married
a lovely girl, who had not a penny to bless herself with, and he
was most deeply attached to her. But although he was very
well off for money, and not at all of a stingy turn, for a long
time it never came into his head that his wife had only two
gowns, two bonnets, and one cloak. She was too proud to ask
him for money; and instead of doing that, went on and on,
wearing out all her poor things, until they were scarcely fit to
be looked at. And many bitter tears she shed, as she darned,
and patched, and let pieces in, convinced more and more, as the
light shone through, that her husband must hate her to keep
her like that. And perhaps it would have ended in the ruin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
them both, for some villain was making love to her, when,
luckily a sister of his came to see them, and scolded him roundly
for his blind neglect. “Why, bless her heart!” he cried, opening
his eyes; “I never see Mary’s clothes—I see Mary.”</p>

<p>“Now mind you are not such a jackanapes as that;” my
Uncle drew the moral, as he rubbed his hands, for he loved to
have his stories laughed at; “when you have got your Kitty,
and I don’t see why you should not, be sure that you praise her
dresses and bonnets; not quite so much perhaps as you praise herself,
but still every time you can think of it. Women like that
sort of thing, somehow. I can hardly tell you why; for if any
man praised my coat or my hat, I should be vexed with him,
unless it was to say that I had got them dirt-cheap. But perhaps
the reason is that a woman’s clothes are a part of her mind and
her body too, a sort of another self to her.”</p>

<p>“How on earth do you know such a lot about women?” I
asked, though I thought that he did not know much. “One
would think you had been married for forty years! What
woman can have taught you all these things!”</p>

<p>“Mind your own business,” my Uncle answered sharply.
“You will have quite enough to do with that, as things
appear at present. You have made play with this pretty girl,
and you have booked your place with her father. Also you
have got over me, who meant to have nothing to do with it.
And you have given that hateful woman a Roland for her
Oliver. But I will go bail that you have no idea whose
shoulders will bear the brunt of it. Who should you say was
the trump-card now?”</p>

<p>“The learned Professor,” I replied; “the man who could
kill that woman with a wire, if he were not so magnanimous.
The man who knows everything in this world, except how to
manage his own household. He will stand up for me, and I shall
win.”</p>

<p>“So you shall, my boy; you are quite right there. But it
won’t be done through him, I can tell you; or you would have
a precious time to wait. It shall be done through a small
market-gardener—as she had the cheek to call me—and she
may grind her teeth, and slap her husband. Very few people
know what I am; because I don’t care what they think of me.
But I see the proper thing to do, and I mean to begin to-morrow.
Now go to bed, and dream as you do all day. You’ll
be no good to me, till you’ve had too much of Kitty.”</p>

<p>Being weary in body and in mind, I slept until Tabby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
called out that the breakfast was ready. For this I expected to
be well upbraided, as my uncle was always afoot with the sun;
but to my surprise he was not come home, and I kept his
rasher hot for him. At last he came in, and sat down without
a word beyond his short “Good morning, Kit!” His appetite
was fine, and his face most cheerful; though his gray curls
appeared a little grimy, and his coat had a smell more peculiar
than pleasant.</p>

<p>“Shall have to go under the pump again,” he said, as he
pushed away his plate; “but it won’t matter now till dinner-time.
That twitch does make such a sticky smoke, with the
sow-thistles whelmed down over it. But the wind was the
right way, and took it very level. Bless my soul, how he did
cough, and how he ran from one room to another! ’Twas enough
to kill American blight a’most, let alone what they call a
‘human.’ But it’s high time to rouse them up again, my lad;
bring one of them runner-sticks, and lend a hand. If he don’t
bolt by dinner-time, we’ll try a little sulphur. I would have
done it sooner, if it had not been for the Dutch Honeysuckle,
and blue creeper.”</p>

<p>Wondering what this device could be, I took a kidney-bean
stick and followed him. He marched at a great pace, with a
pitchfork on his shoulder, down a long alley of pears and
apples; on which, though the leaves hung very late from the
wetness of the season, the chill air of some frosty mornings had
breathed divers colours. Then we came into an open break,
which I had helped to plant with potatoes in the spring, and
here were a score of bonfires burning, or rather smoking
furiously. Beyond them was “Honeysuckle Cottage,” belonging
to my uncle, and standing at the north end of his grounds,
against a lane which led to Hanworth.</p>

<p>This cottage had five windows facing us, and receiving the
volleys of foul gray smoke, as a smart south-west wind drove
it; and the fires being piled with diseased potato-haulm, of
which there was abundance in that bad year, as well as
bottomed with twitch-grass, beth-wine, cat’s-tail, and fifty
other kinds of weed, and still more noxious refuse, the reek
was more than any nose could stand, when even a mild puff
strayed towards us. But the main and solid mass was rushing,
in a flood of embodied stench, straight into the windows of that
peaceful cot, penetrating sash and frame and lining. Once or
twice as the cloud wisped before the wind, we seemed to catch
a brief glimpse of some agitated mortal, holding up his hands in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
supplication, or wringing them, and applying them in anguish to
his nose.</p>

<p>“Pile on some more, Bill, and stir them up again,” shouted
Uncle Corny, with his pitchfork swinging in the thick of it.
“Agricultural operations must not be suspended to suit the
caprice of individuals,—as the County-court judge said, when
Noakes tried to stop me from carting manure near his parlour-window.
If old Harker won’t hearken, well make him sniff,
eh? See the joke, Selsey Bill?”</p>

<p>Selsey Bill saw it, after deep reflection, and shook his
long sides with a longer guffaw. “If a’ don’t sniff at this, a’
must have quare nostrils”—he was wheezing himself, as he
clapped on another great dollop of rottenness, and stirred it;
“I could never have bided it two minutes; though the Lord
hathn’t made me too partiklar. Sure us’ll vetch ’un out this
time, Maister. Here a’ coom’th, here a’ coom’th. Lookey
see!”</p>

<p>Following his point we descried a little man, timidly opening
the cottage door, and apparently testing the smells outside,
to compare them with those he was quitting. He glanced at
the bonfires, and shook his fist wildly; then threw his skirt
over his head, and made off, as if he had smelled quite enough
of this world.</p>

<p>“Run and get the key, Bill,” my uncle cried, as soon as he
could speak for laughing; “lock the door, and bring the key to
me. We’ll send for the fire-engine by-and-by, and wash down
the front, and then put your wife in, and scrub the whole place
out. Beat abroad the fires, men, and throw some earth upon
them. That’s what I call something like an ejectment. The
old rogue has paid no rent since Lady Day; though he had it
dirt cheap at three and six a week, and me to pay the rates and
taxes. Come, you shall have a pint of beer all round. I am
sure you want something to take the taste out.”</p>

<p>As we went home, to have a good wash, and change our
coats, I learned all the meaning of this strong measure, and felt
no more pity for the tenant evicted. He had occupied this
cottage for some seven years now, and although he lived so close
to us and on our land, scarcely any one had exchanged ten
words with him. He was of a morose and silent nature, living
all alone, though he had some money, and never going out
of doors when he could help it. His name was Ben Harker,
and throughout the village his nickname was “Old Arkerate;”
for when anything was said to him that he could pick a hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in, if it were only a remark about the weather, he would always
say—“No. That isn’t arkerate.” It was said that he had
lost a considerable fortune, before he came to Sunbury, by some
inaccuracy in a will, or title-deeds, and thence he had taken to
challenge the correctness of even the most trivial statement.
My uncle had been longing for months to recover possession of
his own premises; but old Harker took advantage of the
obstacles richly provided by English law in such a case, and
swore he would never go out without a law-suit. But he had never
spent a halfpenny on repairs, though he had it so cheap through
his promises; and by his own default he was thus smoked out,
and the key was in the landlord’s pocket.</p>

<p>Mrs. Selsey Bill, mother of seventeen living children, was
very fat and stumpy—as behoves a giant’s wife—and was blest
with a cold in her head just now, which redeemed all her
system from prejudice. The greatest philosophers assure us
that all things—if there be anything—are good or bad, simply
as we colour them in our own minds—that is to say, if we have
minds—and to Mrs. Bill Tompkins the stench of that house
was as sweet as the perfumes of Araby. She flung up the
windows, from the force of habit, and not from “æsthetic preference,”
and she scrubbed away with soda, and fuller’s earth,
and soft soap, and bristle, and cocoa-fibre. And the next day,
as soon as we had finished dinner (which we never left for
nightfall, as if it were a burglary), my uncle said, “let us go
and see how that place looks, after Old Arkerate has had to cut
and run.”</p>

<p>When we got there, fat little Mrs. Tompkins was scrubbing
almost as hard as ever. It is quite wrong to talk as if fat people
cannot work. Many of them can, and can even carry on, by
drawing on their own resources, when a lean person having
hollow places down her begins to pant, and has no stuff to fill
them out. She drew her breath a little, as she got up from
the bucket; but neither of her hands went to her waist,
because there was no such place to go to. She had three of the
young ones strapped down on the floor of the room she had not
yet grappled with; for her husband was of an ingenious mind,
and necessity had taught him invention. Mrs. Selsey Bill
stood up and faced us; she thought that we were come to say
she had not done enough.</p>

<p>“Honourable gents,” she began with the lead, as women
love to do, “it don’t look much; and you might think you got
the worst of one and ninepence for a day, with the days going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
on for dusk at five o’clock. But when you has to find your
own soap and flannels—”</p>

<p>“I think you have done wonders, Mrs. Tompkins;” my
uncle made answer with his pleasant smile. “If I only got
the best of every bargain like this, I need never be out of
elbows, ma’am. Why the stairs are as white as a scraped
horse-radish. May we go up and see the view from the best
bedroom? Not if it will upset any of your clever doings. You
are the mistress now; and we take your orders.”</p>

<p>With a laugh, which challenged our criticism (for no man,
except a sailor, knows the rudiments of scrubbing), she loosed
for us a cord which she had tied across, lest any Selsey baby
might break bonds, and crawl upstairs; and presently we stood
in a pretty little bedroom, with an ample but rickety window,
facing southwards. The room was not too lofty, and I might
have knocked my hat against the ceiling, if I had not doffed it.
But Uncle Corny, being not so tall though wider, had plenty of
head-room, and asked what man could want more. And when
I looked out of the window, I agreed that a man deserved less,
who could not be pleased with this.</p>

<p>For Honeysuckle Cottage stood at the very highest corner of
all his pleasant fruit-grounds; and I was much surprised,
having never been inside this house before, at the rich view of
gardening ever varied, and of fair land and water beyond the
fruit-alleys, which shone in the soft spread of sunshine far
away. Over the heads of countless trees, and betwixt their
coats of many colours, matched by the motherly hands of
autumn, the broad reaches of the flooded Thames, with many a
bend of sheen and shadow, led the eye to dwell with pleasure,
and the heart with wonder. And across the wide water, sloping
meadows, streaked and rounded with hedge and breastland,
spread a green footing for the dark and distant hills.</p>

<p>“Let me see, to-day is Friday—an unlucky day, Kit, for
you to come first to the house. If I had thought of that, we
might have waited for to-morrow. But it can’t be helped now;
and I am not superstitious. On Monday I’ll have Joe and
Jimmy Andrews in, and put all these window-frames and doors
to rights. Then we’ll have Tilbury from Hampton, to see to
the papering and painting, and all that. By the end of the
week, we’ll have it snug and tidy. I have sent all old Harker’s
traps after him to-day. They tell me he has taken that tumbledown
barn of Osborne’s, over by Halliford. I suppose I may
whistle for my back rents. I ought to have distrained upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sticks; but I laughed so, when I saw how he bolted, that I
could not do it. But you’ll have to pay an improved rent, my
lad. You can’t have it under five shillings a week, and
cheap enough at that, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” I asked. “I don’t want a
house; and if I did, how am I to keep it up? I haven’t got a
sixpence to call my own.”</p>

<p>“Then a pretty fellow you are, to make up to Captain Fairthorn’s
daughter! Where did you intend to put her, I should
like to know? But we’ll make that all right, between you and
me and the bedpost. I have got a little nest-egg of your mother’s
money for you, and a heel-tap of your father’s. Didn’t you
know why I smoked that old rogue out? Why, that this might
be a little home for Kit and Kitty.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>AUNT PARSLOW.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a bad thing for any man to be always beating his own
bounds, and treading the track of his own grounds, and pursuing
the twist of his own affairs—though they be even love
affairs—as a dog spins round to catch his own tail. Under
the hammer of incessant thought, and in the hot pincers of
perpetual yearning, I was getting as flat as a horseshoe twice
removed, when Sam Henderson gave a boy twopence to slip
into our grounds, when my uncle’s back was turned, and put
into my hand an envelope addressed to “Samuel Henderson,
Esquire, The Paddocks, Halliford, Middlesex.” At first I
thought, in my slow way, that his object was to let me see
what deference he had won in racing circles; and I smiled
at the littleness of the man. But the boy, who was shaking
in his ventilated shoes, with dread of Uncle Corny, said—“’Tain’t
that side; turn ’un over.” I obeyed his instructions,
and beheld in pencil—“Come down the lane a bit. I have
news for you, important.”</p>

<p>What mortal, dwelling wholly on his own affairs, would not
have concluded that this concerned him, on his own account,
and unselfishly? I hurried on my coat, which had been thrown
off for a job of winter pruning, and in less than two minutes I
had turned the corner and was face to face with the mighty
Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, old fellow,” he said as coolly as if I had come to
recover a loan. “You needn’t turn a hair. It is not about
your Kitty, but my skittish little Sally—Sally Chalker. You
know I told you all about her, the daughter of the old bloke
down at Ludred.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember now,” I answered, with a sudden chill of
disappointment. “I might have known that it was not for me
you were in such a precious hurry. You were very wise not to
come into our place. My uncle is a man of short measures.”</p>

<p>“A man of uncommonly short measures. He will get fined
some fine day, I’m afraid.” Sam laughed wonderfully at his
own wit. “But I know he don’t want me to see his little
tricks. Don’t bluster, beloved Kit; we all do it, and we respect
one another all the more for it. Free trade has turned John
Bull into Charley Fox. I can feel for you, my boy; for now
there’s a foreign rogue come poaching on my preserves at Ludred.
And he doesn’t know how many legs make a horse.”</p>

<p>Sam tapped his own dapper and well-curved legs with a
light gold-headed riding-whip, and his favourite mare, who was
under the charge of a lad down the lane, gave a whinny to
him. “There’s nothing she don’t know,” said Sam; “and her
name it is Sally.”</p>

<p>I was not sure which of the two fillies—for I knew that he
called his sweetheart one, and her name too was “Sally”—my
friend was thus commending. But I rose to the situation, and
said—“Let us go, and rout the fellow out.”</p>

<p>“I was sure you would stand by a brother Briton,” cried
Sam, shaking hands very heartily; “and you won’t find me
forget it, Kit, when old Crumbly Pot comes back again. I am
keeping a look-out for you there, as I gave you my word to do.
It has been kettles to mend, I am told, in the fen-land where
he hails from. I know a Jew fellow who brought him to book,
and was very nearly quodding him. He won’t be back this
side of Christmas, unless my friend is a liar, and then I shall
do you as good a turn as you are going to do me now. Can you
make it fit to come to-morrow? I’ll put my Sally in the spider,
and call for you about ten o’clock. You can tell old Punnets,
that you want to see your Aunt Parslow about important
business—for important it is and no mistake. Think of a dirty
Frenchman nobbling sweet Sally Chalker, and all her cash!”</p>

<p>Old Punnets—as he insolently called my uncle—was glad
enough that I should pay a visit to my aunt, or rather my
mother’s aunt, Miss Parslow, who was said to be worth at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
10,000<i>l.</i>, as well as a very nice house, and large garden, and
three or four meadows by the river Mole.</p>

<p>“You should never neglect such folk,” he said; “you have
no proper sense of the plainest duty. She has only one relation
as near as you are, and he has got plenty of tin of his own.
You might cut him out easy enough, if you tried, and now is the
nick of time for it. Hannah Parslow is as proud as Punch, I
know; and if you can only put it to her, with a little of the
proper grease, of course, that your mother’s son is considered
unfit to marry a young lady, because he cannot cut a shine,—who
can tell what she might do for you? She doesn’t spend
half of her income, I know. I was thinking of it only the other
night. And she might allow you two hundred a year, without
stinting a pinch of Keating’s powder. You love dogs, and dogs
love you. Half the dogs in the village come to see you home.
Make up to Jupiter, and Juno, and the other bow-wows she has
taken to her bosom, and you’ll never want my thirty shillings
a week, nor yet the little balance of your father and mother’s
money. You go and see her, Kit. Don’t lose a day. You
may accept a lift from that fast Sam Henderson; but throw him
over, as soon as you have got it.”</p>

<p>Now, this little speech was as like as two peas to Uncle
Corny’s nature. He had never said a word about meaning to
give me any one pound ten a week—though Heaven knows that
I was worth it; for let the weather be what it would, there was
I making the best of it. On the contrary, I had very seldom
put into the purse (which I carried more for the husk than
kernel) so much as five shillings on a Sunday morning, which
was my uncle’s particular time for easing his conscience about
me. Of course I had my victuals, and my clothes to a certain
extent, and the power to pay his bills (which made people offer
me something sometimes); also I could talk as if the place
belonged to me; but people knew better for at least three
miles away. So that his talking of thirty shillings proved,
without another word on his part, his high and holy views of
marriage.</p>

<p>And again it was like him, to try to put me up to get
something good out of good Aunt Parslow. Whatever I could
get from her would mean so much relief for the Orchardson
firm—as he often called us in his prouder times; though if I
had asked for a penny of the proceeds, he would have banged
his big desk upon my knuckles. But do not let me seem to
say a word against him; for a better uncle never lived; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
I felt his generosity very deeply, until I began to think of
it.</p>

<p>Few things have been more successful yet, and very few
have been better managed, than that drive of ours to Leatherhead.
Possibly Sam was a luckier fellow than myself; and I
think it likely, because he was less deserving. Not that there
was much harm about him, except a kind of laxity in talk, and
a strained desire to be accounted sharp, and a strong ambition
to rise in the world, without cleaning the steps ere he mounted
them. But he showed a fine heart by his words just now—although
he was much ashamed of it—and the pace we were
going at brought it out, for a brisk air stirs up the best part of
us.</p>

<p>“Ain’t she a stepper?” he said, as we crossed Walton
bridge, and dashed through the flood-water, for the high-road
was not made up then; “wet or dry is all alike to Sally. That’s
the way to go through the world, my boy. Julius Cæsar
crossed the river here; and I have got a yearling named after
him. What makes it all the kinder on my part is that he
hasn’t got Latin in his family. How proud the old chap would
have been for me to go out of the custom so! It will set a
whole lot of the Emperors going, if the colt cuts the shine I
expect of him.”</p>

<p>Knowing nothing about the turf, and caring very little, I
let him rattle on about pedigrees, and strains of double blood,
and Waxy, and Whalebone, and I know not what, as bad as
the Multiplication table; and I wondered that such stuff
should form his discourse, when he should have been full of
young ladies. Even the beauty of the country, which was
more than enough to delight the eyes and hold the mind still
with pleasure, seemed nothing to Sam beyond—“Yes, very
pretty. Nice bit of training-ground up there. That’s the sort
of grass that suits milk teeth.”</p>

<p>At last, as we came within a mile of our mark, and followed
the fair valley of the river, I brought him to the business of
the day, having heard enough of Spider-wheels, and flyers, and
so forth; and requiring to know what he expected of me.
We had gone at such a pace, up hill and down, scarcely ever
varying from one long stride, which left every other “trap”
far in the lurch, that but for my boyish remembrance of the
place, I could scarcely have believed that we were almost in
the village.</p>

<p>“Fifteen or five,” he said, “that’s her pace; there’s no halfway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
house for Sally. She walks a good five. Walk is the
word, old gal. Well, all you have got to do, Kit, is just
this. I put up at the ‘Dolphin,’ and you make a
call, with your best gloves on, and your hat brushed up, at
Valley-view House, where your good aunt lives. You have
not seen her for years. So much the better. Tell her that a
distinguished friend of yours, especially esteemed by your
uncle, and well known in the best London circles, has important
business in the town; and that you took occasion to pay
your respects, where they have been due so long. Admire her
dogs, and all that sort of thing; and when she insists on your
staying to lunch, regret very deeply that you cannot leave
your distinguished friend, etc. Then if she is any good,
she will say—‘Do you think he would waive formality?’ and
so on. And you say—‘If he is not engaged at Lord Nethersole’s,
I will endeavour to fetch him.’ I shall happen to be
lounging up the hill, and shall pull out my watch and be
doubtful. But the attractions of the spot are too many for me.
I throw over his lordship, and get over the old lady.”</p>

<p>I promised to do my best towards this, but without any fictions
concerning him; for his best chance lay, as I told him, in
moderation and simplicity. For my aunt, according to my
remembrance, was rather a shrewd old lady; and Sam had
shown some little sense of this, in the choice of what he called
his toggery. All rich adornments, and gorgeous hues, had been
for once discarded; his clothes were all of a quiet gray, and his
tone had subsided from the solar to the lunar rainbow. In
short, he looked more like a gentleman than I had ever known
him look before; and seeing what a fine young man he was, I
felt heartily glad that he had fixed his affections where they
could not imperil mine.</p>

<p>When I entered the gate of Valley-view, nine or ten small
dogs came scampering out, all giving tongue, and all making
believe to be born for one end, namely my end. There
were pugs, and Skye-terriers, and Blenheim-spaniels, and
wiry-coated terriers, and Italian greyhounds, and little ridiculous
toy-dogs fit for a child’s Noah’s ark, and I know not
what else, but no dog of the name of “Silence.” “What a
pack of curs!” I said rather gruffly, and with a gesture of
contempt, for I never did hear such a medley of barks. As dogs
are the most humorous creatures in the world, they immediately
looked at one another and laughed, each applying my
remark to his neighbours. If they had been curs, they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
have felt it more; being all of fine breeding, they took it
lightly, as I said it, for I had no real meaning to offend them.
Then, a great deal more quickly than we settle matters, they
referred the whole question to a grand old pug, with his face
pulled up short, like a plaited blind, by the cords of disgust
at the tricks of mankind, and lots of little pimples, like a
turbot’s moles, upon it. As a chairman of committee he came
up to me, reserving his stump in a very strict line, till my
character passed through the test of his nose. Then he gave
a little doubtful trepidation to his tail, and after another sniff,
a very hearty wag; and with one accord all the doggies set off
to the house to announce that an honest dog was coming.</p>

<p>Miss Parslow was inclined, as appeared thereafter, to
attach more importance to the verdict of her dogs, even as a
Roman admiral should have consulted his holy chickens.
When the dogs came to say that they believed me to be safe,
their mistress put them all into their own room and came out
to the porch to meet me. She knew me at once, though I
might have forgotten her, except for a great event in my life,
when she gave me the first sovereign I ever possessed. Being
a small and slim lady, she rested her head upon the upper
pocket of my waistcoat, which seemed to be an excellent omen.</p>

<p>“Oh, how you do take after your dear mother!” she
exclaimed, with a genial tear or two; “you are not like an
Orchardson, my dear boy, but a Parslow, a Parslow all over!
Why have you kept away from Valley-view till now?”</p>

<p>This was a difficult question to answer, and therefore I
naturally asked another. “How are you getting on, my dear
aunt? And will it put you out that I should come like this?
I wrote last night, but it may have been too late.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the posts are always wrong. Come and sit here by
the fire. We shall have a sharp winter; I am sure of that.
<i>Jupiter</i> knows the weather as well as if he made it. Now
come and tell me all about your own affairs.”</p>

<p>At first I was not at all inclined to do that, preferring to
talk about hers, and desiring some knowledge of her character
and opinions before I began to spread forth my own. But
she took the lead of me, and contrived to get out of me all
about Uncle Corny, and everybody else I had to do with, and
even the whole of my hopes and fears concerning the main
object of my life. For the old can always pump the young,
when they know the right way to hold the handle.</p>

<p>“I cannot see where the presumption is,” she said as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
took my hand and placed it in one of hers and patted it;
“your mother was Annie Parslow, as sweet a young lady as
any Miss Fairthorn. Her father would have been Lord Mayor
of London if he had only lived long enough. The Parslows
were in the tea line, which is equal to almost any. It is true
that she dropped several grades in life by marrying George
Orchardson—”</p>

<p>“And Miss Fairthorn’s friends, if she ever does it, will
say that she dropped several grades in life by marrying Kit
Orchardson.” I felt that I had her there; but she would not
see it.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense, Kit. The case is wholly different.
You may be counted as half a Parslow, while nobody knows
what she is. And you must not consider what her friends
will say, but your own, who are sensible people. You have
acted very wisely in coming over to tell me all about this
affair. I am sorry that the girl is so poor through her father’s
stupid carelessness. You know that I like your Uncle Cornelius,
although he is such a queer character. One of the
most obstinate men on earth, and nearly all men are obstinate.
But he is apt to put things off. He is always waiting for
something else to be ready. I shall pay him a visit as soon as
Mr. Parker’s fly has got its new cushions in, and his bay horse
recovered from his lameness. Then we will settle something
about you. I never let the grass grow below my feet. I
shall make your Uncle Corny come to book. I am quite convinced
in my own mind that he has been keeping all these
years a nice little lump of your father’s money, as well as
your dear mother’s property. No Parslow was ever a beggar
yet. There was none of them but had a silver teapot, as was
only decent in the business. And most of them could fill it
with bank-notes, though I’m not saying that your mother
could. Dear me, what a dreadful to-do there was when she
ran away with George Orchardson! My dear brother vowed
he would never forgive her, although she was his favourite child;
so upright, and fair, and so ladylike, and cheeks like damask
roses! You never see such a sweet face now. All their
education is to learn to stare, and all their polish is like a
brass knocker’s. What they all want is a good stepmother,
to starve and to slap their ears out of them. That may have
made your Kitty nicer than you can expect to find them now.
If I were a young man I wouldn’t marry any girl who had
not been ten years under a strong stepmother. Why, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
many more times is that young man to lounge up and down
the road over there? He is very like the one who comes from
somewhere near you, and has taken a fancy to Sally Chalker.”</p>

<p>“My dear aunt,” I said, “your delightful conversation has
driven him out of my head altogether. It must be Mr. Henderson
who drove me over, a sporting man, but a landlord, and
a very fashionable fellow. He is waiting for me to go back
with him, no doubt, and he will not take the liberty of ringing
your bell. I must not keep him any more. Good-bye, dear
aunt.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that I would let you go without a morsel?
We shall have luncheon in about five minutes. Ask your
friend to join us if he will oblige me. Oh, I do like a shy
man, he is getting so scarce!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>A TULIP BLOOM.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> Leatherheadians used to admit, and could show good
reason for doing so, that my great-aunt Parslow was the
cleverest woman, as well as the most respectable in the place.
But even her abilities were hardly taxed to find in my friend
Sam Henderson any large amount of that element of shyness,
with which she had endowed him through the window. His
merits were rather inclined to dispense with any bridal veil of
modesty, and his charms never mantled themselves in moss,
as the coy rose attracts by retiring. But I was pleased to find
that he behaved much better than any of his best friends could
have hoped; for he dropped all slang, and soared into lofty
places among much more nobility than I had ever heard of.
And I wondered a little at my aunt’s familiarity with all the
great names he was so friendly with; for she never said “No,”
but nodded intimately, whenever he presumed that she knew
the Earl of something, or even the Duke of anything. I could
not resist the conclusion that the Parslows had been in the
peerage, and lost it; probably through excess of greatness, and
consequent peril to the throne itself.</p>

<p>When Sam had told scandals enough of great people, to
keep all Ludred in a ferment for a month—though I noticed
with surprise his delicacy and deference to the fact (if to no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
other) that he was speaking in the presence of a maiden lady—he
played another card, even more effective; he asked, as the
very greatest favour he could think of, the honour of an introduction
to the noblest circle of dogs now existing in the kingdom.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will regret it, Mr. Henderson,” Aunt Parslow
replied, with a smile and a blush, for she had a very pretty
colour still, which had varied with some of his narratives. “My
dogs are perfect little wizards and witches. They took to my
nephew, because he is a Parslow, and perhaps because he is so
innocent. But you have seen so much of the world—”</p>

<p>“Yet kept myself quite untainted by it.” He spoke with
such gravity that I was obliged to turn away. “Next to the
society of accomplished ladies, I enjoy that of horses, and
of thorough-bred dogs. With a very long interval between, of
course. But I scarcely ever meet an accomplished lady.
What a lucky mark I must put to this day! Oh, if I could
only show you my little Tim! He can stand on his tail, and
sing ‘Rule Britannia,’ and beat time with all his four legs in the
air. But compared to your dogs he is nothing but a cur!
What beauties! Why, Miss Parslow, I will never trust my
eyes again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are very pretty, and as good as any children, or
a great deal better, I might say. <i>Jupiter</i>, don’t growl, sir.
<i>Cleopatra</i>, take your teeth out of Mr. Henderson’s boot.
<i>Vulcan</i>, and <i>Venus</i>, and <i>Mercury</i>—oh dear!”</p>

<p>At a signal from <i>Jupiter</i>, the ancient pug, all the pets had
made a rush at the bewildered Sam, and a chorus of yells arose
as he was obliged, in self-defence, to kick at them. Then they
rallied in a body round the corner of the side-board, snarling
and showing their little white teeth, with their bristles erect
and their eyes full of fire, bravely encouraging one another for
a still fiercer charge at the stranger. And he would have had
the worst of it, or killed some of the tiny ones, if I had not
spied a light whip in the lobby, and given Master <i>Jupiter</i> a
crack on his fat sides, which made him bolt with a howl, and
all his army followed suit.</p>

<p>“Oh, how shall I punish them? Do forgive me. I never
knew them do such a thing before. And I thought them
such excellent judges of character! How could I imagine that
they would ever fly at you! And they have pulled down the
cloth, and broken two decanters that belonged to my dear
mother. But that is nothing, Mr. Henderson, compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the shocking fright they have given you. How can I ever
thank you for not killing them?”</p>

<p>Then Henderson, with the skill of Hannibal, turned his
defeat into victory. “What plucky little chaps they are!”
he said; “I did all I could to put them in a rage, on purpose
to test their breeding. Perhaps you saw me flash this pin at
them. If anything drives a small dog wild, it is to catch him
in the eyes with a large carbuncle. But I got the worst of it,
and serve me right. I only hope I may not have hurt any of
the darlings.”</p>

<p>“You are magnanimity itself, my dear sir;” Aunt Parslow
glanced shyly at his very good trousers, which would never be
quite so good again; “the main point is whether you are hurt.
Even a very little dog, you know—.”</p>

<p>“Miss Parslow, a dog, unless really rabid, is not a quarter
so venomous as a cat. If I had been attacked like that by
cats, I could not have dared to show a bit of mercy, even if
they had been prime favourites of yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I cannot bear cats. I am so glad you draw that most
just distinction. Dogs are so noble and generous, so candid
and loving, and chivalrous. They showed that, even when they
did their best to bite you. But a cat is so stealthy, and crawling,
and crafty, and I might even say bloodthirsty. Next to
my dogs, I love my birds, the dear little things that come and
sing, even in the—not by any means an elegant expression—of
winter. Not a robin could live here, until I had my doggies.
But that sounds like the front-door bell! Kit, would
you oblige me by just seeing who it is? Jenny and Biddy are
engaged, I know. What a very strange thing, if it should be
Miss Chalker! Of course, you never heard of our belle Chalker,
Mr. Henderson.”</p>

<p>“Madam, it appears to me that you are all belles here.”
Sam bowed as he spoke, and contrived to convey me a wink as
I left the room, which told me that the very strange thing had
been brought to pass by post, or possibly by telegram.</p>

<p>When I opened the door, I saw a very pretty girl, but no
more to be compared with my darling Kitty, than a tulip with
a lily of the valley. Although it was close upon winter now,
she had a striped parasol, which I detest; and her velvet hat
(turned down over one ear, and turned up at the other) had
two kingfisher’s wings stuck crosswise, and between them a
gorgeous topaz humming-bird. You might look at my Kitty
fifty times; and if any one asked you how she was dressed, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
would have to say, “I have not the least idea,” if you happened
not to be a woman. But this young lady’s attire compelled
attention, and perhaps deserved it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” she said very nicely, and giving
me a smile which made two dimples; “but I thought that Miss
Parslow might he disengaged. I thought I would look in, as
I was going down the town. But I will not intrude, if she has
visitors.”</p>

<p>She made some difficulty about coming in, as if she were
not bent upon doing so; but I told her, with a look, which she
feigned not to understand, that I should never be forgiven if
I allowed her to depart. Then the lady of the house came out,
and brought her in, and introduced her to both visitors. “Oh,
I know Mr. Henderson, a great friend of my father’s; I am so
glad that he knows you, Aunt Parslow. I am sure he admires
your lovely view.”</p>

<p>Now, this was not exactly to my liking. What right had
she to call my Aunt Parslow hers? If I ever met any one free
from petty jealousy, I believe it is the one I see while shaving.
But ever since Sam Henderson came in at my aunt’s door, I,
who had been getting on so well till then, seemed to be no better
than a nobody. He had made himself the hero of the hour,
and played first fiddle, and forced his way into her best graces,
by working on her vanity, and social yearnings, and family
pride, till I quite expected that he would declare himself to be a
Parslow, and entitled to the silver teapot. And now here
was this girl, who had made up her mind, as I could see plainly,
to be Mrs. Sam ere long, daring to address my wealthy relative
as her own Aunt Parslow!</p>

<p>“Kit, you don’t look very well,” said the lady of the house,
after much chatter had been indulged in; “a little change will
do you good perhaps. I suppose you are always up an apple-tree
at home. Would you like to come with me through my
long garden, and give me your advice about one or two things?
The view up the valley is very lovely, and so perfectly rustic.
Jenny will have tea ready, when we come back.”</p>

<p>To this we all agreed with great pleasure, and my aunt contrived
to let Sam and his Sally fall behind, quite out of our
sight among the trees and shrubs, while she took my arm, and
let me carry her camp-stool. <i>Jupiter</i> alone of the dogs came
with us, for she scarcely went even to church without him;
and he certainly was a clever and amusing fellow, full of information,
and yet always adding to it. He looked at me with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
great respect, and not a shadow of resentment for the very solid
whack I had bestowed upon him. His black muzzle, big forehead,
large deep eyes, crow’s feet of experience, and furrows of
philosophy, were relieved of their austerity, every now and
then, by the gentle waggery of his corkscrew tail.</p>

<p>“Now I will show you as lovely a piece of rich English landscape
as ever you saw;” the old lady said, as we turned a
grassy corner. “I have often thought of having a bower made
here; but perhaps that would tend to Cockneyfy it. Let me
have the stool, Kit, and you sit on that stump. The view from
the house is very beautiful, but this beats it, because it shows
another bend, and perhaps the very prettiest bend of all the
valley. You ought to be here in May, Kit, when the lilacs
and laburnums, and the wild-broom, and the apple-blossom,
and the soft green of the trees along the winding river—don’t
talk to me of Devonshire after that. I have never been there;
but I won’t believe it.”</p>

<p>I admired the view, which was very nice indeed, and very
prettily varied in its way. At the same time, I could not help
thinking that some of the broad reaches of the Thames, and
the long spread of meadows with the slanting sun, and the
cattle too sleek to care a flip for flies, and the trees, and the
islands and the glassy quiet—such as we have round our
way—were much more likely to do a man good (which must be
the thing they were made for) than all the sharp turns of a
pretty little stream which our river receives without knowing it.</p>

<p>“You are right, my dear nephew,” replied my dear aunt,
when I had expressed opinions not exactly as above; “it is
indeed a large and noble sight. But I fear that those two
young people behind us will be looking all the time at one
another, and perhaps never know that they are in a valley.
Mr. Henderson is a very pleasant young man, so far as I can
judge, and a clever one, likely to make his own way in the
world, with the help of all the very great friends he has. But
is he to be thoroughly depended on? Has he the strict principle,
and downright honesty, and love of domestic life, without
which no marriage can be truly happy? I have a great regard
for young Miss Chalker; and though her father belongs to
another grade of life, and one with which I have but little
sympathy, I believe him to be a very upright man, and his
heart is bound up with his only child. She has no mother, you
must understand; and I will not lend myself to anything, for
which I could not answer to her father and myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>My aunt fixed her keen grey eyes upon me, and her white
hair added to their force and truth. For the first time I felt
that I had acted rashly, and by no means rightly in the matter,
as she put it. And that she put it sensibly, and honestly, and
kindly, was too evident for my self-content. I should not have
yielded to Sam’s overtures, or at any rate, I should not have
involved her in the case, without being far more sure than I
was at present of his good qualities. I answered as truthfully
as I could, which is the only right thing to do, however it may
end. And I felt that the end might be my disgrace with her.</p>

<p>“Aunt Parslow, I know very little of Sam Henderson.
That is to say, I have known him from a boy, but never been
intimate with him. In our village he is considered rather
‘fast.’ But we are a very steady-going lot; and any one who deals
at all with racing matters, is sure to get that reputation with us.
I have never heard anything against his honesty; if I had, I
should not be with him, until it was disproved. I think that
he is really attached to Miss Chalker; but whether he would
be a good husband for her, is a great deal more than I can say.
You ladies are the best judges of such matters. If you can
give him a good word, do. But it must depend entirely on
your own judgment. For as I said before, I do not know him
at all thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“I am not very sanguine about it,” said my aunt, whose
eyes had never left mine, while I spoke; “and I shall take
good care that, if they meet again here, it shall be with her
father’s knowledge. There is one thing to be said, that they
both belong to the same class in life, and are likely therefore
to understand one another’s ways. The same cannot be said of
you, my dear; and your love is a much more romantic affair,
and likely, I fear, to run no smooth course. There I will help
you all I can, and my advice will be of great service to you.
Also if you want a little money, you know where to come for
it. And that reminds me that you may want some now. Your
Uncle Orchardson is a man, I believe, of great integrity and
fine principle; but I know that he objects very strongly to
parting with any of the means God has given him. If you
are obliged to run away with your Kitty, to save her from
an old reprobate,—and it may come to that, though I dislike
such things—what does your uncle propose to do for you? He
ought to do something handsome.”</p>

<p>“And so he will, something very handsome. He has
promised to pay me thirty shillings a week for my services in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
his business, and to let us a cottage at five shillings a week,
which must be worth seven and sixpence.”</p>

<p>“Exactly like him, the old curmudgeon! Well, I won’t say yet
what I will do, because I have not even seen your Kitty, and I
have of course so many claims upon me. But here is a ten-pound
note, to save you from making your uncle unhappy
by asking him to advance you a trifle; and if you want another
you can have it any day. I am pleased with you, Christopher,
because I think you have told me the truth about all these
affairs, as well as about Mr. Henderson; and <i>Jupiter</i>, who is
the greatest of all judges, has pronounced most strongly in your
favour. Now let us go and look for that sporting pair. Quite
enough of such proceedings in my garden.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />


<small>COLDPEPPER HALL.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> there was a little help of moonlight, Sam drove home
very carefully; for the more a man has to do with horses, the
better he knows where the risk is. And I saw that his speech
about Sally’s speed, as a power that could not be modified, was
a speech, and nothing more. He set me down at my uncle’s
door, with many warm thanks for my kindness, and a strong
assurance that he should now go in and win. But my uncle
was not so well pleased; for he had very little love for Sam,
and much hatred at being kept out of his bed.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t want any supper,” he grumbled; “if
you do, you must go and get what you can find. Your Aunt
Parslow is a wealthy woman, but not the one to feed you as
I do. I’ll be bound she has sent you quite empty away.
There’s a bit of cold hock of bacon in the cupboard.”</p>

<p>I told him that I had been fed like a prince, which only
increased his ill humour. “She wants you to go and do her
trees for nothing. I understand that old woman;” he said, as
he gave me an inch of tallow candle. “But after real turtle
and Champagne, you will be able to make something out of
this. It came by the girl who is old Tabby’s niece, or cousin,
or grandmother, or something. The footman, no doubt, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
too grand to come down here. Don’t bother me with it. I
want my nightcap.”</p>

<p>He gave me a letter, which he had opened, and which was
addressed in a crabbed hand to “Mr. Cornelius Orchardson,
Market Gardener, Sunbury;” and when he was gone, I read
as follows:—</p>

<p>“Miss Coldpepper presents her compliments to Mr. Orchardson,
and will be much obliged if he will send his nephew
Christopher to the Hall at ten o’clock to-morrow morning, as
Miss Coldpepper has something to say to him.”</p>

<p>My conscience being in a dreadful state of nervousness and
discomfort, without anybody to relieve it to, or any one to put
it on, I wondered and wondered what this could mean; till my
dreams, like a thatcher’s pole, twisted it into a thousand ropes of
many-coloured stuff and stream. And when the morning came
at last, I could not set about my work, until I had learned what
Tabby Tapscott thought about this new surprise. She, in her
provoking ways, pretended to know everything, but would only
shake her head and mutter, and tell me to insure my life. At
last I saw that she knew nothing, and the only comfort that I
could find was to tell her that she should never know, because
she was an old humbug.</p>

<p>It was a dull and foggy morning, with a gray rime on the
grass, and dead leaves hanging tipped with wet, and dribbles of
puddles along the walk doubting whether to freeze or flow, and
the whole air reeking with that Job’s comfort, which means
that there is much worse to come. I buttoned my coat and
strode more briskly, though going upon a loth errand, you may
know.</p>

<p>When they showed me in at the tradesman’s door—for I
then looked up to dignities, which exist by being looked up to—a
strange and unaccustomed thing upset all the rally of my
conscience. <i>Regulus</i>, the foremost of all beings in a well regulated
household, came down the passage, at a pace which spoke
nine volumes for his digestion, though his lips were clouted
with fine cream; and instead of taking a nip at me, he threw
up his head, as if he would have taken his hat off, if he wore
one, and indulged in a bark of welcome, which went ringing
back to the hall itself. Then he cut a caper round my feet,
and with the innumerable laughter of his tail, fell fawning, and
begged but a word from me. I have often seen men of small
self-respect do that sort of thing to great personages, but I knew
that this dog was full of self-respect, and had little for other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
people. What was passing in his mind I cannot say, but simply
record his actions.</p>

<p>“Well, I never see the like!” said Charles, who had condescended
to let me in. “Why, he snap’th worse than ever at
me; though the Lord knows how I sweated to get ’un back.
But come along this way, Master Kit; my lady will see you in
the Justice-room.”</p>

<p>He showed me into a square panelled chamber, where old
Squire Nicholas used to rule over poachers and little thieves
brought before him by the parish constable; and with
<i>Regulus</i> still at my heels, I stood waiting anxiously for the
lady.</p>

<p>At length there came a rustle of silk moving slowly,
watered silk, such as we seldom see now, and can scarcely find
time to think of. And as fine as the silk, and as able to stand
alone, was the lady inside it. Although she lived so near to
us, and drove by in her carriage so often, I knew her rather
by sight than speech, and better by report than either. She
was tall, and straight, and of goodly presence, with fine large
features, and a steadfast look, which expressed clear perception
and strong resolve, but less violence of nature than her sister
showed. Her abundant hair, drawn back from her ample
forehead and coiled at the back of her head, would have been
jet black but for a few lines of silver and an undercast of a
tint like that of an American oak-leaf. To me she appeared
more imposing and handsome than her sister Monica; but I
may have thought more highly of her because she lived at
Sunbury. This lady made me a graceful bow, a very slight
one, but still it was a bow, and proved that her nature was
better than that of the Honourable Mrs. Bulwrag. I replied
with a low bend and scrape of my foot, which I always
understand to be the proper thing, in such a case. And the
guilt of my heart, as I thought of her dog, was enough to
account for the deep blush I felt.</p>

<p>“Are you the young Mr. Orchardson,” she asked, “the
nephew of that Mr. Orchardson who owns the large garden
and long walls at Sunbury? Then I have a little matter to
discuss with you. But how strongly my dog seems to take
to you! It is not at all his general character. He is not
at all devoted to mankind. But he has a remarkable
memory. Perhaps you were kind to him when he was
quite young. Or perhaps you were even his master?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am; I know him only as your dog. But most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
dogs are fond of me. An aunt of mine has nine, and I was
with them yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that explains it;” she spoke with a smile which
made her face quite beautiful, and I wondered at the taste of
the Honourable Tom in exchanging her for her sister. “Now
I dare say you know why I sent for you. For some years I
have not seen very much of my sister, now the wife of
Professor Fairthorn, a man well known in the scientific world.
But a few weeks ago Captain Fairthorn asked me to allow his
daughter by a previous marriage to spend a few days with me
here; and I consented, for I knew him long before he married
my sister, and have always felt a great regard for him. There
is no reason why I should enter into that. Miss Fairthorn
was here for about ten days, and she might have been longer
but for you. Who are you, that you should dare to fall in love
with her?”</p>

<p>Now these words look very harsh as written, and would
sound so too, if harshly spoken. But Miss Coldpepper
scarcely seemed to mean them thus; for there was no contempt
in her voice, and I thought that her glance was kind,
though her face was very grave. Perhaps she was thinking of
her own love-time; which would rouse at once pity for
me, and ill-will towards the sister, who then had wronged her
so.</p>

<p>It was difficult for me to answer her, and I was in no hurry
to do so; knowing from dialogues with Tabby Tapscott, that
women are ready to go on again, and perhaps answer themselves,
when provoked to do it. Not that I compared Miss
Coldpepper with our poor Tabby for a moment; only that
much the same rule applies to all women, when they grow
unruly. Their main object is to say something striking, being
forbidden by nature to strike otherwise.</p>

<p>“You have nothing to say then,” continued the lady,
without giving me time to know how much I had; “very
well, I think that it is better so. I have tried to make every
allowance for you, and I am glad not to find you at all defiant.
Miss Fairthorn, of course, has no particular claims of birth to
stand upon; for you know, and perhaps you have thought
about that, that she has none of the Coldpepper blood in her
system. I suppose, if she had, you would scarcely have dared
to behave in this way, Mr. Orchardson!”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, madam,” I replied with genuine truth,
for I must have been frightened at the fearful temper of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
family. And if Kitty had been a Coldpepper, she could not
have owned the sweet face which had won me.</p>

<p>“Really, I do not perceive in you,” her ladyship (as our
people called her) went on in a gentler tone, “any signs of that
audacity with which my sister charges you. To me you seem to
be a well-meaning and fairly educated young man. And it may
be your misfortune, more than fault, that you have given this
offence. You certainly were of the greatest service to my niece—as
I allow her to call herself, although she is no niece of
mine—when that excessively stupid Marker led her into needless
danger. I do not know what I could have said to Professor
Fairthorn, if his daughter had been swept away, through the
folly of my housekeeper. And more than that, I was beginning
to grow rather fond of that young girl. I found her so ready,
and clever, and obliging, and free from the conceit the young
people show now. When she was taken away like that, I
missed her very sadly, and felt for her deeply at having to go
back to—to so very dull a house. But I wish you to understand,
young man, that though I am not in a position to forbid,
I cannot in any way sanction, or even approve your suit to her.
And I trust that your own common sense will induce you to
withdraw it, and try to forget her. You may think it hard.
But it must be so. Will you promise to think no more of
her?”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot do that;” I answered in a low voice, which
grew stronger, as my heart warmed with my words. “I will
tell you no falsehood, Miss Coldpepper. As long as I live, I
must think of her, and no one else in all this world. She is
more to me than my life, my soul, or even my hope of another
life. From the moment I first set eyes upon her, there was
nothing else worth living for. The Lord, who governs all our
ways, and knows what is the best for us, has been pleased to
give me her pure love, a greater gift than the life He gave; and
with His aid I will hold it fast; and He alone shall ever part
us. I am not accustomed to strong words, but these are weak
to what my meaning is.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think they are pretty strong; but I will not blame
you for them.” She turned from my eyes, which were bright
with deep passion, as behoved a well-bred lady. “When
things have come to such a pass, there is little more to be said
or done. Only it occurs to me, who have seen a good deal of
men and women, that these brave words are often said, and for
the moment felt, no doubt; but in a few years, or even one, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
perhaps a month—where are they? A new love, equally the
gift of Heaven, comes in with still hotter fervour; and the
old one is whistled down the wind. And why should it not
be so with you?” I knew that in the heat of the moment,
she was referring to her own case; and my place was to be
silent.</p>

<p>“Christopher Orchardson,” she said at last, recovering her
business tone, “I have delivered my message to you, and it has
not made much impression. To me the matter is of little
moment, except that I like Miss Fairthorn more than I ever
expected to like a girl again. And I am not pleased, as you
may suppose, that she, with her youth, and abilities, and beauty,
should make so poor a marriage. Have you thought of this?
Have you considered whether you have any right to take her
from a rank in life, or at least from a social position above
your own, and keep her in a cottage, among working men,
with a scanty and perhaps doubtful income? You are a man
of spirit; do you think this fair?”</p>

<p>This was the point of all points, which perplexed me more
than I could settle. She saw how deeply her words had
moved me, and waited with a grim smile for my reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have fully considered that; and it is the one
matter I doubt about. You have put it more clearly, madam,
than I could put it, and entirely without exaggeration. And I
scarcely know how to answer, without referring to things that
may pain you. But you may be aware that Miss Fairthorn at
present leads a most unhappy life. And even worse than that,
everything is being done to force her into a miserable marriage
with a man of more than twice her age, and of anything but
good character. He is supposed to be rich, but is poorer than
myself, because he owes more than he can pay. She had
better go to her grave, than become the wife of such a person.
From this she has no escape except the quiet home I can give
her. And to live among working men, who would respect, and
look up to, and admire her, is surely less of a degradation than
to be brought into wild and rough company, as in the other
case she must be. It will be known here, that she has had the
honour of your acquaintance and liking; and though you may
not think fit to continue it, under the change of circumstances,
people will value her by what has been. And as for being
happy, what is there to prevent it? She will live in a
beautiful place and fine gardens, where there is always plenty
to look at, and enjoy, according to the time of year, abundance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of flowers, and fruit, and good living, my uncle to make much
of her, and myself to worship her, and nobody ever to say a
cross word.”</p>

<p>“It is not surprising that you have won her consent,”
Miss Coldpepper answered gravely, “if you have put your
proposals thus. How could a poor London girl resist such a
programme? And Kitty loves the country, as a lark or a
wood-queist does. Well, you must understand that I will
have nothing more to say about it. I have been asked to tell
you what I think, I have done so; and there is an end of
it.”</p>

<p>With these words, she rang the bell, for some one to show
me the way out; but having found her much less awful than
I had expected, I was not content to let well alone, but must
needs try to get further.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I said, “you have listened so kindly to all I
have ventured to tell you, that I hope you will let me ask one
question, without being thought impertinent. It is only that
I should like to know, who it is that has begged you to speak
to me, and whether Captain Fairthorn is aware of it.”</p>

<p>At once her demeanour was changed to me, and her lofty
indifference was gone. Her eyebrows rose, and her eyelids
quivered, and her face flushed with wrath, like a storm-cloud
with the sun.</p>

<p>“I think that I have listened too kindly to you, and the
things you have dared to tell me. It will teach me to have less
to say to underbred young men henceforth. Charles, show this
young man where the front door is.”</p>

<p>This was very clever, and abashed me deeply; as if I had
no right to know any other than the back-entrance. And I
observed that she did not lose her self-command, nor revile me
as if on her own level, as her far less dignified sister did. I
was much more entirely smitten down, and made sensible of
my distance from her, as one too deep to be bridged by words.
And yet the sense of justice, which is always strongest in the
young, stood up and bade me take all this as only of human
ordinance. For no thought of presumption had been in my
mind, or of undue familiarity. A cat may look at a king;
and the king (like a dog) hath only his own day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>AT BAY, AND IN THE BAY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Every</span> one, who can call to mind that year of bad weather,
1860, will bear me out in saying that it showed no weakness,
no lack of consistency to the last. Rain and chill were the
rule of the summer, snow and severe cold the order of the
winter. In the beginning of December, the earth was sodden,
and the rivers thick with flood. Then the sky was amassed
with fog, and the trees hung low with trembling drip, and even
the humble weeds and grass were bearded with a glaucous
reek, not crisp nor bright as of rime or frost, but limp, and dull,
and bleary. Having never seen such a thing till now, I could
not tell what to make of it; but Uncle Corny, who had been
compelled for years to watch the weather, said—“Up with all
the winter apples, and the Glou Morceau, and Beurré Rance,
up with them all to Covent Garden, or we shall have them
frozen on the shelves. Or even if we can keep the frost out,
we shall have the van snowed up. Things looked just as they
do now, in December, 1837, only the ground was not so wet.
Go down to the barges, and order in ten tons of coal, we shall
want it all, and twenty chaldrons of gas-coke. The frost will
last till February, and fuel will cost a rare price then.”</p>

<p>I was inclined to laugh at this as a bold and rash prediction;
but it was more than verified by the weather that set in upon
the eighteenth of December, not with any sudden change, but
the cold growing more decided. By this time Honeysuckle
Cottage was thoroughly cleansed, and in good trim, painted,
and papered, and neatly furnished, with Tabby put in to keep
it warm, but only permitted to use one room. And I used to
go there every day, and sit in the little parlour, reading the
only letter I had yet received from one who was more to me
than words. It was written in a small clear hand, and dated
on the very day after my visit to her, and the purport of it was
to comfort me and persuade me to wait with all endurance,
until I should have leave to come again. And long as the time
had seemed, and dreary, and empty of all except distant hope,
I had done my best to get through it, with the courage of a
man, and the faith of love.</p>

<p>“It is for my dear father’s sake,” she wrote, “that I am
compelled to ask you this. There has been a fearful scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
which even his sweet endurance and wonderful temper could
scarcely carry him through, without sad injury to his health
and work. His heart is not very strong, and though he tries
to laugh these troubles off, or despise them as below his notice,
to me it is plain that they worry and wear him, a great deal
more than he deigns to show. And I know that he bitterly
reproaches himself, although he so rarely speaks of it, for
having been so deluded as to place nearly all his property in the
power of those who should only have a part. When he looks
at me and sighs, I know exactly what he is thinking of; and it
is my place to save him from all that can be avoided of strife
and ill-treatment. A more placid and peaceful man never
lived, yet comfort and peace are denied him. In a few weeks
he will leave home again—if this house can be called a home—and
then I should like to see you, dear, with his permission
before he goes; because I am not afraid for myself, and I may
have to settle what is to be done, if a certain gentleman
should come back, and try to force his visits upon me, while
my father is away. If this should happen, you shall hear at
once, unless I am locked up, as I used to be sometimes. Do
not write; she takes every letter; and it would only cause
more misery. We must trust in Heaven, and in one another;
for I know that you love me, as I love you.”</p>

<p>This very faithful and sensible letter was beginning to grow
threadbare now, or rather was returning to its original state of
thread, with my constant handling. And it left me in a sore
predicament, which became sorer, as time went on, and no
other tidings reached me. It was grievous to reflect, that with
better policy, and judicious flattery, I might perhaps have
contrived to get a scrap or two of information even from the
stately lady of the Hall, or at any rate through Mrs. Marker.
But that good housekeeper shunned me now, probably under
strict orders; or if ever I managed to bring her to bay, she
declared that she knew nothing; and perhaps this was true,
for the choleric sisters held little communication. As a last
resource, I got Mrs. Tapscott to promise her niece the most
amiable tips for every bit of tidings she could bring; but
nothing came of that, and by this time verily my condition of
mind was feverish. In vain I consulted that oracle of the
neighbourhood—Uncle Corny; for an oracle he was now
become, partly through making good figures of his fruit, partly
through holding tongue and shaking head, and partly no doubt
by defeating the lawyers, and smoking out “Old Arkerate.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
But all I could win from this oracle was—“Go up, and get in
at the window.”</p>

<p>I was ready to get in at any window—big enough for my
head to pass—if only I could have found Kitty inside, and
quick to forgive me for coming. But to talk is all very fine,
and old men make it do for everything; to act is the province
of the young, who have not found out how vain it is.</p>

<p>Being touched up therefore on every side—for even old
Tabby made sniffs at me, and Selsey Bill winked, in a manner
that meant—“Would there ever have been seventeen young
Selseys, if I had hung fire as you do?”—and my Uncle said
quietly, between two puffs—“In for a penny in for a pound;
that used to be the way when I was young”—being stirred up
more deeply by my own heart, which was sadly unquiet within
me, I set off at last, without a word, and not even a horse to
help me.</p>

<p>The frost had set in, that mighty frost which froze the
Thames down to Kingston Bridge, and would have frozen it to
London Bridge, except for one pause at the end of the year,
and the rush of so much land-water. The ground was already
as hard as iron, but no snow had fallen to smother it up. The
walking was good, and the legs kept going to keep one another
and the whole affair alive. There must have been a deal of
ground soon overcome between them; for they were not out of
Uncle Corny’s gate till Sunbury clock struck three, and they
knocked against the gate of Bulwrag Park, when the twilight
still hung in the sky. And this had been done against a bitter
east wind, with a low scud of snow flying into the teeth, and
scurfing the darkening road with gray.</p>

<p>Here it was needful to reflect a little; for to think against
the drift of air is worthless, for anything weaker than a six-wheeled
engine. I found a little shelter from the old Scotch
firs, and halted in their darkness, and considered what to do.
The house, about a hundred yards away, looked cold, and grim,
and repellent, and abhorrent, except for one sweet warmth inside.
The dark shrubs before it were already powdered with
the gathering crust of snow; and the restless wind was driving
cloudy swirls of white along and in under the laps of blue slate.
So far as I could see, one chimney only was issuing token of
some warmth inside. I had scarcely shivered yet in the fierce
cold of the road, and the open tracks where no road was; but I
shuddered with a deep thrill of anguish and dismay, as I
watched that bleak house, with the snow flitting round it, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
bitter frost howling in every wild blast, and not a scrap of fire
to keep my sweet love’s body warm.</p>

<p>“If they have not quite starved her, since her father left,”
I said to myself, being sure that he was gone, “they will not
lose this chance of freezing her to death. I have heard what
they do in such weather. They keep her where the water-jugs
burst, and the ice is on the pillow, while they roast themselves
by a roaring fire. May they roast for ever!”</p>

<p>Slow as I am of imagination, this picture had such an effect
upon me, that I caught up my stick which had stood against
the tree, and determined to knock the front door in, if they
would not admit me decently. But glancing back first, to be
sure of having the place to myself, I beheld through the wind-hurried
flakes an advancing figure. Two looks were enough; it
was my darling, bending to the wind, but walking bravely, and
carrying a basket in her ungloved hand. Her little thin cloak,
and summer hat—for they had given her no other—were as
white as the ground itself with snow, and so were the clusters
of her rich brown hair, which time shall whiten by the side of
mine. But her large blue eyes and soft rosy cheeks were
glistening bravely through the fleecy veil, and a smile of resolve
to make the best of all things showed little teeth whiter than
any snowflake. Through the brunt of the storm she had not
descried me, until she was suddenly inside my arms.</p>

<p>Then she dropped her basket in the snow, and looked up at
me, and tried hard to be vexed. But nature and youth were
too many for her, and she threw her glad arms round my neck,
and patiently permitted me to leave no snow either on her face
or in her curls.</p>

<p>“Oh, Kit, if they should see us from the house!” she
whispered; and I said,—</p>

<p>“They had better not, or they shall have this stick.”</p>

<p>However, for fear of any rashness about that, I led her with
a smooth and easy pace—for she could move beautifully with
my arm round her, which no clumsy girl could do—to a snug
little nook, where a large bay tree broke the power of the
wind, and screened the snow. Here we found a low branch
upon which we could sit, with the fragrant leaves to shelter us;
and ever since that when I smell a bayleaf, I can never help
thinking of my love, even when it is in pickled mackerel.</p>

<p>When I had told her a thousand times of my delight at
finding her, and she, with a hundred blushes perhaps, had
begged me to show it judiciously, I asked where she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in such dreadful weather, and what she had got in the basket.
“Two bottles of brandy,” she answered as coolly as if it had
been a cowslip ball; “from the Bricklayers’ Arms I had to
fetch them, because nobody else would go out in the storm.”</p>

<p>“What!” I cried, looking at her pure and bashful eyes, “do
you mean to say that you are sent alone to a common public-house,
where the navvies go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they never say anything to me, dear Kit. But I
cannot bear to go, when there are noisy people there. And I
believe that my father would be angry if he knew it. It has
only happened once or twice, when the weather was very bad.”</p>

<p>“Does she ever send her own daughters there?” I asked as
mildly as I could, for Kitty was trembling at my natural wrath,
and stern manner.</p>

<p>“Oh no! She would not like to send them at all, even if
they would go, which is very doubtful. But she says that my
place is to be useful; and she never can do without brandy
long. She gets tired of wine in the evening.”</p>

<p>“The case is just this,” I said, wishing to let off my wrath,
that I might speak of more pleasant things; “she revels upon
your father’s money, and squanders it on her children’s whims;
she locks him up in a corner of his own house, makes a slave
of his only child, starves and beats her, and degrades her by
sending her for drink to a pot-house. A young lady—the best,
and the sweetest, and noblest—”</p>

<p>I was obliged to stop, in fear of violence. But my dear one
became all the dearer to me, as I thought of her misery and
patience. If my Uncle Cornelius tried to “put upon” me,
was I ever known to put up with it? And consider the difference
betwixt an uncle, who fed me, and kept me, and allowed
me money—or at any rate promised to do so—and a vile stepmother,
who ruined the father, and starved and bullied and
disgraced the child! Truly we learn to forget right and
wrong; as our country has learned in these latter days.</p>

<p>“No one can degrade me, but myself,” Miss Fairthorn
answered gently, and without any thought of argument. “But
I will not go again, if you think it wrong. I have been so
accustomed to run errands for her, that I never gave a thought
to the difference at first, and having done it once, I could not
say ‘no’ the next time. But I know it is not nice; and I will
never go again, now that I know you object to it, dear. You
won’t be angry, when I have given you my promise?”</p>

<p>“To send an angel to a public-house”—but I said no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
about it, for the angel sighed, and put her hand into mine, to
be forgiven. Then I asked her, with my wrath turning into
jealous pangs, about that old villain, who had dared to imagine
that his wealth—if he had any—or at any rate his position,
could bridge over the gulf between virtue and vice, loveliness
and ugliness, sweet maidenhood and sour decrepitude of bad
living. Of these things I could not speak to her; but her
modesty shrank, without knowing why.</p>

<p>“That poor old gentleman has been very ill,” she answered
in her clear and silvery voice, which made me thrill, like music.
“He went to see to some business in Lincolnshire, and was laid
up for weeks with ague. But he is to come back when the
weather permits. If he had appeared, I would have let you
know, for I should have been frightened, with my father not at
home. But I am sorry to say there is some one coming, more
formidable to me than Sir Cumberleigh is. You will think I
am full of dislikes, dear Kit, but I do dislike that Downy so.
He is her son Donovan, her only son; and she worships him—if
she worships anything.”</p>

<p>I had heard of this Donovan Bulwrag more than once, but
knew very little about him, except that, unless he was much
belied, he combined the vices of both his parents. But my
duty was now to reassure my Kitty, and leave her in good
spirits, so far as that was possible. Though every minute of
her company was as precious as a year of life to me, I was fearful
of keeping her longer in the cold, and insuring a very hot
reception from her foes. Of the latter, however, she had not
much dread, being so inured to ill usage, that a little more or
less was not of much consideration. But her cloak was threadbare,
and her teeth began to chatter, as the keen wind shook
the tree above us, and scattered the snow upon our shoulders.</p>

<p>In a few words we arranged to be no longer without frequent
news of one another; for I told her very truly, that
without this luck I must have gone home in utter misery, unless
I had forced my way to her; and with equal sincerity she
replied, that she did not know what she could have done, for
the time had been dreary and desolate. Then she promised to
write to me every week, not long love-letters, for of those there
was no need with our pure faith in one another, and her opportunities
would be but brief; yet so as to let me know that she
was safe, and not persecuted more than usual. These letters
she must post with her own hand, and my answers she must
call for at a little shop kept by an old servant of the Captain’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
who would not betray her. If possible, she would write on
Saturdays, so that I might get the letter on a Sunday morning;
and if anything were added to her troubles, I might come, and
try to let her know of it through Mrs. Wilcox, who kept the
little shop she had spoken of. With this I was obliged to be
content for the present; much as I longed for a bolder course,
she would not leave her father, without his full consent.</p>

<p>“But you shall have something to remember me by, and
something too that came from him,” she whispered, as her fears
began to grow again. “He gave me a watch on my last birthday,
a beautiful watch with a blue enamel back, and Kitty done
in little diamonds. She said that it was much too good for me,
and she gave it to Geraldine, her youngest girl. But oh, I
cheated them out of something, because I felt that they were
cheating me. They never knew that he had given me a gold
key for it, a lovely little key with a star in the centre. Here
it is, see how it sparkles in the dusk! Take it, my dear, and
wear it always, and you will think it is the key of my heart,
Kit, which you managed to steal down at Sunbury so. You
must not give me anything in return. Not now at least;
perhaps some day you may.”</p>

<p>It was now so dark that I ventured to lead her, and carry
her basket to the little side-door, for that part of the house was
dark and empty. Then she gave me a sweet farewell, with one
little sob to strengthen it; and the snow whirled into her
glistening eyes, and a shiver ran through me, when she was
gone.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>HARO!</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A strange</span> thing befell me on my way home, which I would
have avoided describing if I could; for my adventures have but
little interest, except so far as they are concerned with Kitty.
But this one unluckily did concern her deeply, inasmuch as it
brought great affliction on her, and left her without my assistance,
at a time when she stood in especial need of it.</p>

<p>She had made me promise that I would not attempt to walk
all the way to Sunbury in such a bitter night, and with the
storm increasing, till no one could tell what might come of it.
Accordingly I made my way to Notting Hill, intending to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
into an omnibus there, which would take me at least as far as
Richmond. There I meant to have a mutton chop or two, and
perhaps a pint of Mortlake ale, which is generally of good substance,
and thus be set up for the cold walk home. And if this
had been done, as was really intended, probably I might have
been at home in good time to tell my uncle all about it, before
he had finished his go-to-bed pipe.</p>

<p>But as it happened, when I came out at last, from all this
brick and mortar skittle-ground, into the broad Western road,
and knew pretty well where I was and how the land lay, not
an omnibus was to be found anywhere, except those that had
travelled out before the storm began, and were bound to get
home again somehow. And these had some trouble in getting
along, with the snow clouding up in the horses’ faces, and
forming great balls on their feet, and clogging the dumb, heavy
roll of the frozen wheels. All the ’busses that should have
been ploughing and rolling towards Shepherd’s Bush and Turnham
Green, had resolved to remain in their yards for the night.
Let other horses tug, and wallow, and smoke like beds of
mortar; let other coachmen flap their breasts and scowl instead
of answering; and let other threepenny fares look blue and
stamp in the straw to thaw their toes. It was worth much
more than the money would fetch, to cross their legs by the
taproom fire, or whisk their tails in stable.</p>

<p>At first I took it as a wholesome joke, that the fourteen miles
of road before me must be overcome by toe and heel. As for a
cab, I had never been inside any feminine bandbox of that
name, and if I would have condescended to it, there was no
such thing to be got to-night. I was young, and strong, and
full of spirit, with the sweet words kindling in my heart, as
memory stirred it from time to time; and if any one had bidden
me look out for danger, I should have said, “Let me see it
first.” And in this humour, I strode on, without even turning
my collar up.</p>

<p>But the world became wrapped up more and more in deep
white darkness, as I trudged on. As the houses along the road
grew scarcer, they seemed to go by me more heavily and slowly,
and with less and less power of companionship. There was
scarcely a man to say “Good-night” to; and the one or two I
met would not open mouth to answer. And when I came
through a great open space, with a white spire standing like a
giant’s ghost, I could hardly be sure that it was Turnham Green,
so entirely was distance huddled up with snow. But I ran into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
a white thing in the middle of the road, and the gleam of an
ostler’s lantern showed me that it was a brewer’s dray, with the
horses taken out, and standing with their heads between their
legs close by a sign-post. “You better turn in, mate,” the ostler
shouted; “you’re a fool if you go further, such a night as this.”
I saw a red steam in the bar, and knew that this must be the <i>Old
Pack-Horse Inn</i>, whose landlord had raised a famous apple;
and my better sense told me to follow advice. But the pride of
fool’s strength drove me on, and without slacking a foot I lost
sight of it in the solid daze.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be afraid of yet, and I felt no kind of
misgiving, but began to let my legs go on, instead walking consciously.
At one time I began to count, as if they were a
machine of which I was no longer master. I counted up to a
thousand, and thought—“About seven thousand more will do
it, and that they can manage without much trouble.” Then I
gave up counting, and must have passed through Brentford,
as in a dream, and so to Twickenham, and through that again.</p>

<p>There were nearer ways in better weather; but although I
could not think clearly now (through cold, and clogging feet,
and constant dazzle of white fall around me) I had sense
enough to stick to highways, as long as they would stick to me.
At Twickenham I had a mind to stop and get something to eat,
being faint with hunger, for I had seven and sixpence in my
waistcoat pocket. I cannot tell why I did not stop, and only
know that I went on.</p>

<p>The snow must have been ten inches deep on the level, and
as many feet in the drifts, for a strong wind urged it fiercely,
when I came at last to the <i>Bear</i> at Hanworth, an old-established
and good hotel. The principal entrance was snowed up, from
the sweep of the roads that meet there, for every road running
east and west was like a cannon exploding snow. But I went
in by the little door round the corner, and finding only the
barman there—for all neighbours had been glad to get home
while they could—I contrived, with some trouble, to ask for a
glass of hot brandy and water. So great was the change from
the storm and the whirl, that my brain seemed to beat like
a flail in a barn, and the chairs were all standing on the
ceiling.</p>

<p>“Don’t you go no further, sir; you stop here,” said the man,
who seemed to know me, though I did not know him. “It
would take a male helephant to get to Sunbury to-night
There’s been no such snow for six and forty year; old Jim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the ostler can call it to mind; and then it was over the roof,
he saith. You look uncommon queer already, seem to be
standing on your head a’most. Why, bless me, you be drinking
from the empty glass!”</p>

<p>But I found the right glass with his help, and swallowed
the hot brown draught without knowing it. Then I asked
him the time, and he said, “Nigh on ten o’clock. You take
my advice, and have a bed here. Well, wilful will, and woeful
won’t, when it’s too late to mend it.” He cast this at me as I
said “Good night,” and without sitting down, staggered out
again.</p>

<p>I believe that even now I should have reached home
safely, not having so very much further to go, if the roads
had been wide and straight as they were thus far. But two
things were very much against me now, and both of them
made a great difference. I had turned from the main road
into twisting narrow lanes, and my course was across the wind
instead of right before it. Without that strong wind at my
back I could scarcely have reached Hanworth by that time,
though it seemed a very long time to take from Notting
Hill, compared with the usual rate of walking. But now the
fierce wind was on my left side quite as often as behind me,
and it drove me from my line, as I grew more feeble, and
knocked my weary legs into one another. Moreover, it seemed
to go through me twice as much, and to rattle me like splinter
shaken up, and to drive the spikes of snow to my heart almost.</p>

<p>If I had walked as in a dream before, I was moving as in a
deep sleep now. I had some sort of sense of going on for ever,
as a man has a knowledge of his own snoring; and I have
some weak remembrance of beating with my hands—for my
stick must have gone away long ago—to keep off a blanket that
was smothering me. Then I seemed to be lifted, and set down
somewhere, and it did not matter where it was. And what
happened after that was not to me, but to people who told me
of it afterwards.</p>

<p>For my Uncle Corny went to bed that night, in a very bad
worry of mind, and fitter to grumble at the Lord than to say
his prayers. Not from anxiety about his nephew, who was sure
to turn up somehow; but because he had frightful misgivings
about his glass, and his trees, and his premises at large. The
roof of his long vinery was buckled in already, when he went
with a lantern to look at it; and many of his favourite apple-trees,
which he loved to go and gaze at on a Sunday, were bowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
with the wind and the snow, and hanging in draggles, like so
much mistletoe. He never swore much at the weather; because
it seemed like swearing at heaven, and he had found it grow
worse under that sort of treatment. But our Tabby Tapscott
(who feared to go home, and tried to sleep on two chairs in the
kitchen) declared that he used some expressions that night,
which were quite enough to account for anything.</p>

<p>In the morning, however, there was no fault to find with
him, as soon as he had done a good hour’s work in the deep
snow and the nipping wind, and improved his circulation by
convincing everybody that he was still as young as he ever was.
He relieved the laden trees, wherever it was wise to do so, and
with the back of a hay-rake fetched the white incumbrance
from the glass, and stamped his feet and shook his coat, and
had a path swept here and there, and told himself and Selsey
Bill, that a good old-fashioned winter was the thing to send all
prices up. But when he sat down to breakfast, he kept looking
at the door, as if for me; and at last he said to Mrs. Tapscott,
who was shaking in her apron—“Why, where’s that lazy Kit
again? Is he frozen to his pillow? Go and give him a good
rattle up. He deserves cold victuals, and he shall have nothing
else.”</p>

<p>“Her bain’t coom home,” replied Tabby, looking as crossly
as she dared at him. “Much you care for the poor boy,
measter. I rackon the znow be his winding-shate. No more
coortin’ for he, this zide of kingdom coom, I’d lay a penny.”</p>

<p>“Kit not come home! Kit out all night, and you let me
go on with my trees and roofs! But you know where he is, or
you would not take it so, and you snoring away by the kitchen
fire. None of your secrets about him. Where is Kit?”</p>

<p>“The Lord A’mighty know’th where a’ be.” Poor Tabby
began to whine and cry. “The zecret be with Him, not me.
A’ wor to coom home, but her never didn’t. A vaine job for
e’e to zake for ’un. Vaind un dade as a stone, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Kit can take care of himself. He is the
strongest young fellow for miles and miles, and accustomed to
all sorts of weather. What’s a bit of snow to a young man
like Kit? You women always make the worst of everything.”</p>

<p>“But her bain’t coom home;” answered Tabby with all
reason. “Her would ’a coom home, if so be her worn’t drowned
in the znow, I tull ’e, sir. No more coortin’ for Measter
Kit, in this laife. A’ may do what a’ wool, in kingdom
coom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stuff!” cried my uncle, not caring to discuss this extreme
test of my constancy. “He has stopped at some house on the
road, or up there. Perhaps the Professor would not let him
go, when he saw how bad the weather was. There is nothing
to be done, till the post comes in; though I am not sure that
the post will be able to get in. If the letters are not here by
ten o’clock, I shall go to Hampton to look for them. They are
pretty sure to get that far.”</p>

<p>The morning was fine, though bitterly cold after that very
heavy fall; and people began to get about again, though the
drifts were too deep in many places for a carriage to pass till
they had been cleared. My uncle set out on foot for Hampton,
and there found the mail cart just come in. The postmaster
was in a state of flurry, and would not open the Sunbury bag,
but sent it on by special messenger, as the cart could get no
further. My uncle had the pleasure of walking with it as far
as our post-office; and after all that there was nothing for him.
“Well, a man must eat,” was his sound reflection. “I shall
have a bit of dinner, and consider what to do.”</p>

<p>It was getting on for two o’clock, as they told me, when a
man who had come from the Bear at Hanworth, upon some
particular business in our village, knocked at my uncle’s door
on his return, to say that I had forgotten (which was the truth)
to pay for what I had the night before. He was also to ask
how I got home, because I looked “uncommon dickey,” as he
beautifully expressed it. In half an hour every man in Sunbury,
owning a good pair of legs, and even a number of women
and boys, set forth to search the roads and fields, for it was
hard sometimes to tell which was which, in the direction of
Hanworth. This was no small proof of the good-will and
brave humanity of our neighbourhood; for any of these people
might have lost themselves in the numb frost, and the depth of
drift; and there were signs of another storm in the north-east.</p>

<p>My uncle, with a big shovel on his shoulder, and a bottle
of brandy in his pocket, put a guinea upon me at first, and
then two, and then jumped to five pounds, and even ten, as
the hope of discovery waned; and at last, when some had
abandoned the search, and others were muffling themselves
against the new snowstorm, he mounted a gate and with both
hands to his mouth shouted—“Five and twenty pounds for
my nephew Kit—dead or alive; twenty-five pounds reward
to any one who finds Christopher Orchardson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>This may appear a great deal of money for anybody to put
me at (except my own mother, if I had one), and the people
who heard it were of that opinion, none of them being aware
perhaps that the reward would come out of my mother’s
property, which had no trustees to prevent it. And for many
years afterwards, if I dared to think anything said or done by
my uncle was anything short of perfection, the women, and even
the men would ask—as if I were made of ingratitude—“Who
offered five and twenty pounds for you?”</p>

<p>And they felt the effect of it now so strongly that a loud
hurrah went along the white plain, and several stout fellows
who were turning home turned back again, and flapped themselves,
saying, “Never say die!” With one accord a fresh
pursuit began, though perhaps of a ghost even whiter than
the snow; and taking care to keep in sight of one another,
they began to poke more holes, wherever they could poke
them. For some had kidney-bean sticks, and some had
garden forks, and some had sharp pitch-forks from the stable;
and if they had found me, I had surely been riddled, and
perhaps had both my eyes poked out. But the Lord was good to
me once more, and I escaped being trussed, as I might have been.</p>

<p>For just when it was growing dark, and another bitter
night was setting in, with spangles of hard snow driving, as
they said, like a glazier’s diamond into their eyes, and even
the heartiest man was saying that nothing more could be done
for it; through the drifting of the white, and the lowering of
the gray, a high-mettled horse came churning. It was beautiful,
everybody thought, to see him scattering the snow like highway
dust, flinging from his nostrils scornful volumes, with his
great eyes flashing like a lighthouse in the foam. Men
huddled aside, lest he should spurn them like a drift, for his
courage was roused, and he knew no fear, but gloried in the
power of his leap and plunge.</p>

<p>“Giving it over, are you all?” Sam Henderson shouted,
as he drew the rein, and his favourite stallion <i>Haro</i> stood, and
looked with the like contempt at them. “Then a horse and
dog shall shame your pluck.”</p>

<p>From beneath the short rough cloak he wore, a pair of
sharp eyes shone like jewels, and two little ears pricked up
like thorns.</p>

<p>“<i>Spike</i> is the best man here,” said Sam, as the wiseacres
crowded round him. “All you have done is to spoil the track.
Keep behind me, and let me see things for myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>My uncle, who never had been fond of Sam, said something
disdainful and turned away; but Henderson, without
even looking at him, rode on, and the best men followed him.
He took them almost to the <i>Bear</i> Hotel, watching both sides
of the road, as he went, and still keeping his dog before him.
Then he turned back, and said, “Keep you all on my left.
None of you tread any gap on the right. I saw the place as I
came along. When the moon gets clear, we shall find him.”</p>

<p>The snow-cloud in the east began to lift, and the moon
came out with a bronzy flush, as my uncle told me afterwards,
and the broad expanse of snow was flickered with wan light and
with gliding shades. Then all came back to the place where
Sam, being mounted and able to command the slope, had discovered
certain dimples—for they were nothing more—which
might be the trace of footsteps snowed over. Here he gave his
horse to be held, and leaving the road with his little Scotch
terrier <i>Spike</i>, scooped the light surface from one of the marks,
and found a hard clot beneath it. He put the dog’s nose in,
and patted him, and <i>Spike</i> gave a yelp, as if a rat were in prospect.</p>

<p>“Let him alone. Don’t say a word to him,” cried Sam, as
our people grew eager. “He don’t want you to teach him his
business. If you knew your own half as well, there’d be less
money in London than in Sunbury. Keep back, I say, all of
you.”</p>

<p>The little dog led them across a broad meadow, two or three
hundred yards from the highway, yet in a straighter line towards
Sunbury, and nearly in the track of an old foot-path.
Then he stopped in a dip, where a great rise of snow, like a
surge of ground-swell, swung away from them, and combed over
into the field beyond without breaking, like the ground-swell
frozen. They said that it was a most beautiful sight, such as
they never had seen before, and could scarcely hope to see again
in one lifetime; reminding them of the great wax-works, when
the wax is being bleached, at Teddington. But they could not
stop to look at it; and the little dog went round, and dived into
the tunnel on the further side.</p>

<p>Presently he yapped, as if in hot chase of a rabbit; and an
active young fellow jumped through the great wave, and was
swallowed up, leaving his hat behind. Then they heard him
crying faintly, “Here he is! Come round, and dig us out to
this side.”</p>

<p>It is a strange thing, and I have not the smallest remembrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of having done it; but I must have dragged my frozen body
through the hedge, in the cope of life with death, and got on
the leeward side of a stiff bulwark of newly bill-hooked ashplant,
which stopped the sweep of drift, and served to cast it like the
lap of a counterpane over me. In the bottom where I lay
there was scarcely any snow, but a soft bed of fallen leaves,
upon which they found me lying like a gate-post flung by, to
season.</p>

<p>“Dead as a doornail!” said Rasp the baker.</p>

<p>“Stiff as a starfish!” cried Pluggs the grocer, who had spent
his last holidays at the seaside.</p>

<p>“Ay, and colder than a skinned eel!” added Jakes, the
barrowman.</p>

<p>But my uncle said—“Out with you, coward lot of curs!
Our Kit shall outlive every one of you. The Lord hath not put
him in that nest for nothing.”</p>

<p>Then Sam Henderson pulled off his cloak, like the Good
Samaritan, and threw it over me. And taking me by the
shoulders, with my uncle at the feet, he helped to bear my
stiff body back to the road; where they set me upon <i>Haro</i>,
with my head upon his mane; and the young man who had
jumped into the drift was sent ahead, to fetch Dr. Sippets to
my uncle’s house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>ON THE SHELF.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">That</span> season, there was no Christmas-tide for me; no “Happy
New Year,” to wish to others, and be wished; nor even so much
as a Valentine’s Day, to send poems to girls, and get caricatures.
In the leeward of the wild storm, I had been saved by a merciful
power from the frost of death, and by constant care and indefatigable
skill, I was slowly brought back into the warmth of
life. But strong as I was, and of tough and active frame, with
habits of temperance and exercise, there was no making little
of the mischief done; and I could not have survived it, if I
had been a clever fellow. For one of the most racking and
deadly evils of all that beset the human frame was established
in mine, and there worked its savage will. When I was just
beginning to get warm again, and to ask where I was, and to
stretch my tingling joints, symptoms of rheumatic fever showed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and for weeks and for months it ran its agonizing course. The
doctor did all that any man could do; and my uncle went up
to his cupboard in the wall by the head of his bed, and brought
down a leather bag, and looked at it fondly, and then looked at
me.</p>

<p>“It was put by for a rainy day; and there can’t be a
rainier day than this,” he said with some drops in his own
eyes, as Tabby told me afterwards. “Let the business go to
the dogs, if it will. Where’s the use of keeping up, with no
one to keep up for? Dr. Sippets, I never thought to see this
day. Fetch the best man in London, and let him cheat me, if
he will.”</p>

<p>If I had been at all a clever fellow, my mind would have
stayed with me, and worried out my heart, when dreadfully
pushed to carry on its proper work, with the lowering and the
heightening, and the quivering of the pulse. But being just a
simple mind, that took its cue from body, and depended on the
brain for motion, and the eyes for guidance, when these went
amiss it quite struck work; and never even asked who its
master was. Thus it came to pass that Kitty’s sweet and
tender letters lay upon a shelf but a yard or two away, and no
hand was yet stretched out for them.</p>

<p>At last there came a letter sent in special trouble, as was
plain from many signs upon it, and from the mode of its
delivery. For Mrs. Wilcox came herself, the roads being once
more passable, and perceiving how things were in the house
had a long talk with my uncle. This good woman, as I may
have said, was much attached to Miss Fairthorn, and had
promised to take charge of my replies, and even to give me
tidings of her, if anything happened to disable her from
writing. But no provision had been made for any default
on my part, as I was supposed to be free, and strong, and sure
to come when called for.</p>

<p>“The poor young thing has been in such a taking,”
Mrs. Wilcox told my uncle, “at not having so much as a
single line from your poor nephew, you see, sir. You may
put it to yourself how you would feel to be looking and looking
for letters about business; and this is worse than business
to young folk; they goes on as if it was all the world to
them. And Miss Kitty always did have such an uncommon
tender heart; you never see the like of it in all your life.
What was she to conclude except that Mr. Kit had throwed
her over, and perhaps taken up with some of them country girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
down here. It wasn’t, you see, sir, as if he had written once,
and told her he meant to stick fast to her. And yet she
couldn’t bring her mind for to believe that such a nice young
gent would be guilty of such conduct; and of course she knows
right well how bootiful she is, though you never see her look
that sort of way, as young ladies with a quarter of her good
looks does. I declare to you, sir, when I was in the ’bus,
holding of this bag exactly as you see me now, I felt that I
could scratch out both his eyes, tall and strong as he is by
Miss Kitty’s account. Bless her gentle heart, what a way she
will be in, when she hears she have thought ill of him undeserving.
Though a relief, sir, on the whole, for I believe
she never done it; and better be in a snow-drift than belong to
another woman.”</p>

<p>“You are a remarkably sensible lady,” said my uncle,
desiring to make the best of things. “But I do not like to
open poor Kit’s letters; and there are six of them already on a
bracket by his bed, waiting till he comes round a bit. You
must understand, Mrs. Wilcox, what this means. He isn’t off
his head, exactly, but—you know that we all get a little abroad,
when we lie on our backs so long as not to know our legs.”</p>

<p>“I do, sir, I do. I can feel it all through me, by means of
what happened to my own husband. Ah, he was a man—could
take a scuttle full of coals, and hold it out straight, the
same as you might march up the aisle on a Sunday, with your
hat right for’ard, to show that it was brushed and shining.
But poor Wilcox, he went away at last, with a tub of clothes
in his lungs, and the same may occur to the best of us; mayn’t
it, Mr. Orchardson? But if you feel a delicate sort of feeling
about breaking open the young lady’s letter, and the young
gent from the snow-drift is still looking at his legs, I can tell
you a good bit of what is going on; though I never was one,
and Wilcox knew it, for hearkening so much as a word they
say, when the women have done with their teas, and the men
stand against the low green palings, with a pot, and a pipe as
long as their shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it do appear that two bad ones has turned up,
over and above the one always there, which I will not name,
consequent upon fear. One was Sir Cumberance Hotchpots, or
some such name, proving to be a wicked man from the North;
and the other was her brother, as ought to be all over, according
to the flesh of marriage, sir. Donovan Bulwrag is his
name, but every one prefer to call him ‘Downy.’ A hulking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
young man is my opinion of him; and it has been my lot to
behold a good many. You may see it on the tables, sir,
that come down from the Mount, going into church any
Sunday, that such is forbidden by the law of Moses, for any
Christian man to marry. Their father is one, and their mother
is one; and they have no right to make a pair of them. You
holds on with that, sir, as a respectable man, who has trodden
his way in the world, is bound to do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Wilcox, I hold to it strongly,” said my uncle,
“if I understand you. Do you mean to tell me, that this
young man—”</p>

<p>“There is the facts, sir, and none of my telling. I was
always a very bad hand at telling, though Wilcox he used to
say otherwise, when he might be overcome in argument. But
facts or no facts, the truth is as I tell you. This Mr. Donovan
have come home, from Germany, or some such foreign parts;
and whatever his meaning is, that is what it comes to—Miss
Kitty can’t have no peace with him. And a yellow young
man, Mr. Orchardson; as yellow as a daffodil, his hair, and
beard, and eyes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a fig what his colour may be,” cried my
uncle, being now on his high ropes; “he must be a black
blackguard, and nothing else, if he dares to take advantage of
a girl he should protect. Poor Kitty, what a pretty kettle of
fish she is in! You need not tell me, ma’am, I can see it all.
I have always had a gift in that way. Though I have not had
so very much to do with women, for which I thank the Lord,
every night of my life, I understand their ways, as well as if I
had been one of them.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be a wonderful man, sir, indeed. The
most wonderful I ever come across.” Mrs. Wilcox smoothed
her dress, as if to ask what was inside it, but reserved her own
opinion as to what was not.</p>

<p>“I mean it,” said my Uncle, who grew stronger always,
whenever called in question. “It may not be the general
thing; but so it is with me. And now I would venture to ask
you, ma’am, what you consider the next thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the lady, highly flattered by request for
advice from such an oracle, “if I were a strong man and a
very clever one, I know what I should do at once. I should
go up and fetch her away from them all, and let none of them
come anigh her.”</p>

<p>“And what would you say, ma’am, supposing you had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it, when you found yourself served, the next morning perhaps,
with a warrant for abduction of a maiden under age, and then
committed for trial as a criminal? What would you say to
that, Mrs. Wilcox?”</p>

<p>“I should say that the laws was outrageous, and made for
the encouragement of vice and wickedness. And I should put
it in the newspapers, right and left, till the public came and
broke down the doors of the jail, and got up a public subscription
for me.”</p>

<p>“Where is her father? What is he about?” My uncle
thought it waste of time to argue after that. “Her father is
the only person who can interfere. Has he been knocked on
the head, and killed by one of his own battering rams?”
Mr. Orchardson’s knowledge of scientific matters was more
elementary than even mine.</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge, sir; though like enough that will
be the end of him. He have gone to the ends of the earth, I
believe, to arrange for going ever so much further in the Spring.
There is no help to be got from him, sir, now, if there ever was
any chance of it. The poor young lady is delivered as a lamb
between two lions to devour her, with a tigress patting them on
the back, and holding her down while they carry it out. What
will Mr. Kit say, if you allow it, sir?”</p>

<p>“You may be quite sure that I will never allow it, though
at present I cannot see what to do. You have quicker wits
than we have, ma’am; I ask you again, is there anything you
can think of? Has her father any friends who would take
her in?”</p>

<p>“Not one, to my knowledge,” answered Mrs. Wilcox, after
counting on her finger-tips some names that she had heard of;
“that dreadful creature have contrived to make every lady in
the land afraid of her. And the poor Professor only knows
the learned men, and the learneder they are the less they cares
for one another. ’Tis the learning that is at the foot of all this
trouble. You must see it so yourself, sir, when you come to
think about it.”</p>

<p>“And the law, Mrs. Wilcox, the law is still worse. She is
not of age, you see; and her father has placed her, or at any
rate left her, in the charge of that woman, whom he has been
fool enough to marry. If my nephew were in health, I should
say to him at once, ‘Take the bull by the horns, or at least
take the young lady, get a licence, and marry her, and defy
those people. Her father’s consent has been given; and if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
chooses to leave her in that helpless state, you must rescue her,
and have no shilly-shallying. But for me to come and take
her, is another pair of shoes. It might ruin her fair name, as
well as get me into trouble; and what could I do with her,
when I had got her?”</p>

<p>“You are right, sir; I see it all as clearly as you put
it. But will you come up, and have a talk with her? A
word from you would go as far as ten from me. And it would
make her feel so much less forsaken like. I could manage to
get her down to my little place, and the news I have got for
her about poor Mr. Kit will set her up in one way, while it
knocks her down in another. Oh, how she have cried, to think
that he could be so false to her, because she wouldn’t believe a
single word of it, all the blessed time! And now, if I can
send my little Ted to her to-night—the sharpest little chap he
is, in all the brick and mortar trade; he have never lost a
sixpence, sir, from all them roaring navvies—though you might
not think it, it will brisk her up amazingly. There is nothing
so hagonizing to the female spirit, sir, as to find itself forsaken
by the other sex. And your nephew, Master Kit, he mustn’t
think of dying yet; no cough about him, sir, nor nothing in
the kidneys, only got a chill from being frozen to a hicicle, and
his head upon the moon, which goes for nothing. Lor’, sir,
the number of young men comes every day, from the best part
of London, too, according to my Ted, a-staring at the great
works round our way, which is to be the fashion in a few more
years, and not a head among them fit to go upon a donkey!
It doesn’t matter what’s the matter with the head, one item,
sir, in these times now upon us and increasing daily. Keep
your spirits up, sir, and I shall tell Miss Kitty. A young man,
as is all right, except inside his head, isn’t no more to complain
of than a cuckoo-clock, that have left off striking, and keeps
better time for that. What time did you say the last ’bus at
Hampton was, sir? If I was to lose it, wherever should I be?
And a good step from here to Hampton, too.”</p>

<p>“I will send you to Hampton, in the spring-cart, Mrs.
Wilcox,” said my uncle, warmly joining in her estimate of the
age; “and to-morrow, if the roads permit, I shall hope to
call upon you, about eleven o’clock; and if you can manage to
get Miss Fairthorn to meet me, why, it may be a little comfort
to her, and we may be able perhaps to see what can be done
for her.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>A DOWNY COVE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> could hardly be expected that my Uncle Corny should grow
very miserable about this matter. He knew that young people
of the ordinary cast tumble into love and tumble out again,
with perhaps a little running of the eyes and nose, and a hat
crushed on the head, or a ribbon saturated; but nothing that
penetrates the skin, far less puts a “tub of clothes,” as Mrs.
Wilcox said, into the lungs. And it would not have been
reasonable to demand of him, that he should believe in any
grand distinction between the case of Kitty and myself, and
that of any other couple he might come across, in a life whose
main nucleus was Covent Garden. That which chiefly moved
him, as he told me in the end, and as I might have known
without his telling, was the iron sense of justice, gilded haply
at the corners, and crowned with a little touch of chivalry. To
his sturdy sense of right it seemed a monstrous thing, that an
innocent girl, and such a lovely girl, should be locked away
from all who were longing to help her, and left at the mercy of
two bad men.</p>

<p>Therefore he donned his Sunday clothes, though he grumbled
a good deal at having to do it, and without a word to me, put old
<i>Spanker</i> in the shafts, and drove away alone in the green spring-cart,
with a face which made all the village say to one another,
that he must have a County-court job on his hands. Dr. Sippets,
who came to see me every day, had by this time supplied such
a row of medicine-bottles, that we glazed a new wall with them
forty yards long, for he would not allow a farthing on their
return, though he put them in the bill at twopence halfpenny
apiece; and that glazing brought him even more than that much
again, from the number of boys’ fingers which he had to dress.
For he was a skilful, as well as zealous man, and did his utmost
for his patients and his family.</p>

<p>He had now begun to “exhibit” mustard oil externally, as
well as zinc, and especially sulphur inside; till the sulphur
began to ooze through my pores, as if I had been a tea rose
suffering from mildew. Then Tabby had to rub me with the
mustard oil; and the more I groaned, the surer she became of
its effect. With this vigorous treatment I began to rally, and
even heard Uncle Corny depart, and contrived to steal a peep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
at him behind the window curtain. But they told me some
fib about his errand.</p>

<p>When he put up his horse, somewhere near Holland Park,
he had not far to walk to find Mrs. Wilcox, who received him
with great cordiality. And she sent her little Ted, who proved
to be the very boy that had guided me among the brickfields,
with a note which he managed to convey to Miss Fairthorn.
“Rumpus going on,” he said when he came back; “they makes
more rumpus in that house, than a score of navvies over one
red herring. But cooky’s not a bad sort; she’ll give it to her.”</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour before Miss Fairthorn came, and then
she was so nervous, and down-hearted, that they scarcely knew
what to do with her. At first she had quite forgotten Uncle
Corny, having never seen him in his best clothes at home, and
being distracted with sorrow and ill usage. For as yet Mrs.
Wilcox had been unable to get a word with her about the visit
of the day before. Gradually, however, she began to understand
what had happened, and why she had not heard from me.</p>

<p>“Then he has not forgotten me, after all!” she said, in a
tone that made her old nurse sob, and my uncle look out of
the window. “Something told me all along, that he could
not forget me, any more than I could do such a thing to him.
But you say that he is ill, that he has long been ill; and perhaps
he will never be well any more. Tell me the truth, I
would rather know it. Is he dead, is he dead, Mr. Orchardson?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, thank the Lord, he is all alive, and getting
ever so much better every day. He went off his head, just a
little for a time; and he did not know me from the man in the
moon; and what do you think was the word that was on his
tongue, all day, and all night too for that matter? Guess, and
I’ll tell you if you are right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what it was! It began with a K, and it was
not a very long word, was it? It was ‘Kitty.’ Don’t tell me
that it was anything but ‘Kitty.’”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, I won’t, because I never tell fibs. Sure
enough that was it, like a cherry-clapper; only in a hundred
different tones. I used to say that if you were there, you’d get
heartily tired of your own name.”</p>

<p>“Never, so long as it came from his lips. But I think I
should have broken my heart, all the same. It has been the
kindest thing you could do, to keep all knowledge of this long
suspense from me. How soon will he be better? How soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
will he be well again? Well enough, I mean, to come down
and let me see him?”</p>

<p>“At present, Miss Fairthorn, wherever he is not mustard,
he is brimstone. You cannot expect him to present himself
in that condition. But we have got the mischief out of his
joints by this time. Dr. Sippets considers it a very happy thing
that the ailment flew there; for his heart will be all right,
and that’s a great part of the system, in love. His head is of
no importance in that condition; and Mrs. Wilcox proved to
me last night, that it is quite a superfluity in the present days.
Madam, you know you did, and you did it thoroughly.”</p>

<p>My uncle gave a wink at Mrs. Wilcox, not with any overture
to familiarity—for he was very shy of widows—but to
intimate to her that she should talk a little nonsense, after his
example, as a rescue from hysterics. For poor Kitty had been
passing through much outrage all the morning; and now to be
met with this shock of strange news (bad to her head, but
perhaps good for her heart) after such a long time of dejection
was enough to throw the finest daughter of Divine Science
into some confusion as to all her organisms. But she fetched
herself back from the precipice of sobs, with a deep draught of
air, and spoke as she did not feel.</p>

<p>“If he is being treated like—like beef, I think I ought to
have a voice in the matter. Will you let me come down, and
do it for him—or see that it is done properly? My father has
taught me so many things—”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said my uncle, being truly thankful to her, for
not even pulling out her handkerchief, “you are the sweetest
young lady I have ever met. No, you shall not come down and
nurse our Kit; not only because it is not the place for you,
but also that it might be very bad for him. His mind must
not come back with a jerk, however pleasant the jerk may be.
He must come round slowly, and he has begun to do it, under
Tabby Tapscott’s scrubbing-brush. But you shall come and
see him, in a week, my dear, if you think you can hold out so
long here. And now tell me, what is going on, to urge your
gentle nature so.”</p>

<p>The young lady looked at Mrs. Wilcox, as if she could
hardly tell what to do. She was very unwilling to refuse my
uncle anything he might ask her; and yet she could not bring
herself to speak of such matters to him.</p>

<p>“I will tell you all about it, when she is gone,” said the
lady of the shop, as if hurried for time; “but I know by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
look that she is getting in a fright. What will they do, if they
catch you out, dearie?”</p>

<p>“I defy them. I defy them. They may do what they like.
Now I know that Kit stands fast to me, after all he has suffered
for my sake, am I likely to show the white feather? Uncle
Corny, I will come away with you, and let them do their worst,
if you will take me.”</p>

<p>She pulled her hat down on her forehead, and drew her
crinoline into small compass, as if she were ready to mount our
spring-cart; and her manner had such an effect on my uncle—for
very pretty girls do even more by attitude, than by words
or looks—that he saw himself driving her away, and looking
back with a whistle of defiance at the world. Moreover she
had called him “Uncle Corny,” which put him on his mettle to
deserve it; and though there have been few men born as yet,
with more gift of decision in their nature, he looked at her
lovingly, and hesitated.</p>

<p>“It will not do,” Mrs. Wilcox interrupted, as if she were
once more in office as nurse. “Of law I know nothing, sir, and
you do; as you was pleased to tell me yesterday. If her father
was at home, and sanctioned it, no doubt it might be in your
jurisdiction”—the good lady was proud of her law, and
repeated—“it might be in your jurisdiction, sir. But without
any sign of that, where should we be? Pulled up for conspiracy
against the realm, and nothing for me, but to put my
shutters up.”</p>

<p>“I fear that you are right, ma’am,” replied my uncle,
“though I don’t care twopence for the law sometimes, when I
feel better law inside me. But it is the young lady we must
think of first. We must let her do nothing to injure herself.
Have patience, my dear. They may torment you in the house,
but they cannot take you out of it, and marry you to anybody,
against your own will and pleasure. Your will and pleasure is
to have our Kit; and with the will of the Lord, you shall do
so.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I must go back. There seems nothing else to
do;” Miss Fairthorn spoke very sadly, looking from one to the
other, and trying to be cheerful. “But if the worst comes to
the worst, will you find a place for me, Uncle Corny? I have
got a little money my dear father gave me; and they shall
take away my life, before they get it.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, well said indeed, my dear!” This alone was
needed to confirm my uncle in his high opinion of her. “What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
a wife you will make for a steady young man! Yes, my dear
child, I will find you a place, and you shan’t pay sixpence for it.
And none but your father shall take you away, unless the Lord
Chancellor comes himself to fetch you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Then I shall know what to do. I am not so
much afraid of them, now I know that Kit is true. I shall
say to myself—‘What is this to put up with, after all that he
has borne for me?’ Give him my best love, and tell him to
get well, and sit by the window, and look out for me. Good-bye,
Uncle Corny; I will not attempt to thank you. Good-bye,
nurse. I don’t deserve such friends. They may do what
they like now, and I shall only laugh.”</p>

<p>“She deserves the best friends, and she shall have them
too,” Mr. Orchardson said, as soon as she was gone, with little
Ted to see the way clear for her; “that’s what I call a downright
good girl, without a bit of humbug in her. A fig for their
science! Will it ever produce such a fine bit of nature as that
is? Now tell me, as far as you can, Mrs. Wilcox, what is it
they want to do with her, why they torment her so, and what
we can do to stop it?”</p>

<p>My uncle laid his watch on the table, because he wished
to be home before dark, and the days, though drawing out
nicely, were not very long. He knew that the lady with
whom he had to deal, instead of putting things into small
compass, would fetch a large compass about them, whose radius
would only be lengthened by any disturbance or hurry on his
part. So he merely placed his watch as a silent, or at least a
comparatively quiet witness, and reproof; but the scheme
failed, as it deserved to do. All he obtained by it was a lesson,
which he often repeated afterwards—never set a watch to go
against a woman’s tongue; it puts her on her mettle to outgo
it; and one wants winding, but the other never does.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilcox had not so very much to tell, but she found a
vast quantity to say, and never said it twice to the same effect.
Stripped of her embellishments, reflections, divergencies, and
other little sallies, it was something as follows.</p>

<p>Captain Fairthorn had been called away to see to the fitting
of some ship near Glasgow, with engines of a special kind, and
large coal-storage, so that she might keep at sea for months
together—seven years the lady said, but that looked like a
lady’s tale. And there were to be wonderful appliances, such
as had never been heard of, on board her, as well as every
kind of scientific instrument, all under the Professor’s own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
direction. If ever a man was in his own element, this was the
man, and the time and place were there. No wonder that he
forgot all other things below the moon; and it was much to
his credit that before he started, he insisted on a promise from
his wife and two step-daughters, that his dear child Kitty
should be treated kindly, and harassed by none of them while
he was away. Upon that condition only, would he send them
every month a handsome sum out of the liberal payment he was
to receive for his services. And he thought himself very firm,
and most sagacious—even suspicious it might be—in providing
that before he drew each cheque, he should have by post a line
from his own daughter, to this effect—“I am very happy, and
every one is most kind to me.”</p>

<p>Unluckily his suspicions were not very shrewd; for he
forgot that there were pens and ink and fingers at Bulwrag
Park, quite apart from Kitty’s, well able to afford him that
assurance in her name, for the gift of forgery was in the family;
and his daughter was not to distract him with letters, so long
as he knew that she was comfortable.</p>

<p>No sooner was he off the scene, than that old rake, Sir
Cumberleigh Hotchpot, reappeared, having purposely kept away
till then, for he dreaded the simple and calm man of science.
He annoyed poor Miss Fairthorn with his odious advances, and
coarse familiarity, and slangy talk, and he took a mean
advantage of her gentle diffidence by perpetually assuming that
she was pledged to him. This, and the contempt and spiteful
hatred of her stepmother, seemed more than enough for the
poor girl to have to bear; but soon a far greater distress was
added. Donovan Bulwrag, the only son of the Honourable
Mrs. Bulwrag Fairthorn—as she absurdly called herself—came
home from the Continent, where he had been engaged on the
staff of some embassy, after running from his debts; and the
house, and the people, and the chattels therein were not good
enough for him to tread upon. This would have mattered
little to Miss Fairthorn (who was rarely favoured with the
Bulwrag society, except for the purpose of insults if this divine
Downy, as his mother called him), had not taken into his great
yellow head the idea that he was in love with Kitty.</p>

<p>This dearly loved son of his mother was a strong young man
of three or four and twenty, able to take his own part anywhere,
either with violence or with fraud, but preferring the latter,
when it would do the trick. Mrs. Wilcox said that he had
three crowns to his head, which went beyond all her experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
although she had been in a hospital. She had known malefactors
with two sometimes, and you never could tell where
their mischief began, because it started double; but she had
combed the hair of this boy once, and nothing would tempt her
to do it again. She was not superstitious, but afraid more
often of being too much the other way; and she left it
entirely to the future to prove her a fool, if she deserved it.
Only let any one look at his head.</p>

<p>For it was not only that he was bad inside, but that he gave
the same idea at first sight, to any one having any sense of
human looks. It was not Mrs. Wilcox alone who said this,
but my uncle as well, when he happened to see the young
man, while going to look for his horse. He had notice that he
might have the luck to meet him, and sure enough he had, if
there was any luck in it. And my Uncle Corny, though a man
of strong opinions, did not go so entirely by outward show.</p>

<p>Mr. Downy Bulwrag, as the grandson of a Lord, and likely
enough to be a Lord himself, if people in his way died out of it,
had a sense of being somebody, and liked the world to know
that he was rather an important part of it. Not that he
swaggered, or stuck out his arms, or jerked himself into big
attitudes—as some bits of the human chip do—all that he left
for fellows who had yet to prove their value, and knew much
less of life than he did. His manner and air were of solid and
silent conviction, that without him this earth would be a place
unfit for a civilized race to inhabit. He prided himself, if he
had any pride, upon his knowledge of human nature; and like
most who do that, he attributed every word and every action to
selfishness, spite, and cupidity. And like the great bulk of such
people again, he was truly consistent in his own freedom from
any loftier motives.</p>

<p>His mother’s pet name for him had been confirmed by all who
had the honour of knowing him. He was downy in manner,
as well as appearance, and (according to the slang of the day) a
“downy cove” in all his actions. No one could look at his
bulky form (which greatly resembled his father’s), enormous
head furnished with bright yellow hair, soft saffron moustache,
and orange-coloured eyelashes, without thinking of a fat, downy
apricot, and fearing that he had none of its excellence. His
face, too, was flattened in its own broad substance, as that
yellow fruit often is against the wall, and bulged at the jowl
with the great socket of square jaws. But the forehead was
the main and most impressive feature; full, and round, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
almost beetling, wider even than the great wide jaws, but for
its heaviness it would have looked like the bulwark of a mighty
brain; and there was room for the brain of a Cuvier in that
head.</p>

<p>My good Uncle Corny, meeting this man in the road, and
knowing who he was from description received, clapped his
keen gray eyes with emphasis upon him, as much as to say, “I
mean to look you through, young man.” Downy, with his
usual self-esteem—which stands like a dummy at every loop-hole,
when the garrison of self-respect is gone—gazed at the
grower with a placid acceptance of rustic admiration. Little
did he dream that another creak of his boots would have
brought the crack of a big whip round his loins; for my uncle
was a hasty man sometimes, and could prove it his duty to be
so. And the heavy half-somnolent look of Downy—as if he
were gaping with his eyes almost—was enough to put a quick
busy man in a rage, even if he had no bone to pick with the
man who was making a dog of him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>OFF THE SHELF.</small></h2>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I had</span> missed “the enjoyment of that bad weather”—as one of
our workmen called it, when he drew his wages <i>gratis</i>—through
having too much at the outset. There had been at least six
weeks of frost, some of it very intense; and it was said by those
who make a study of such things, that Christmas Day, 1860,
was the coldest day known in the south of England, since
Christmas Day, 1796. And but for a break at the end of the
year, when a sudden thaw set in before the steady return of low
temperature, it is likely that the Thames would have held an
ice-fair above London Bridge; as in 1814, and as threatened
again in 1838. But the removal of old London Bridge has
made perhaps a great difference in that matter.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I could not get rid of the chill that
struck into my system, was perhaps the renewed attack of cold
every night through all that bitter time. For in old-fashioned
houses like my uncle’s, there was no fireplace in the bedrooms;
and a frying-pan full of hot embers, our Tabby’s device, used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
set us a-coughing. Every now and again I seemed to hear,
when I called my wits together, the crisp light glint of the
gliding skate, the hollow heel-tap of the gliddering slide, and the
sharp, merry shouts of boys and men dashing at the hockey-bung
in the jagged, slippery huddle. Then more snow fell, and
the ice grew treacherous, and all was mantled in a white hush
again.</p>

<p>But now the days were milder, and the ice had broken up,
and the roads were full of quagmires as they always are, when
a long frost has gone to the bottom of their metal; and everybody
said that it was very brave of my good Aunt Parslow to
pay a guinea for a fly, and come all the way from Leatherhead,
to see if I was still alive. And it was not for the sake of being
kept warm on the road—though that was the reason she assigned
for it—that she obtained permission from Mr. Chalker to bring
his pretty daughter on the visit she was paying. Miss Parslow
was long past the age of lovemaking, and had made a sound investment
of her affections among the grateful canine race; but
none the less for that she felt an interest in watching the progress,
or it might even be the backslidings, of her own species
in the fine old game. And Sam Henderson had conquered all
her prejudice against him, by riding over more than once in the
worst state of the roads, when no wheels could pass over them,
for no other purpose, as he positively avowed, than to comfort
her kind heart about her dear nephew’s illness.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me,” she said, as soon as she had seen me, and
cried over me a little, for I was desperately weak; “what he
wants is warmth, and change of air, and particularly careful
nursing. He will fall into a decline, if he stops here; and then
what will become of his darling Kitty? What chance has he
here in this wretched little room, like a frog, or an empty
bucket hanging in a well? And here you are giving him gruel
and tapioca! Has he ever had a pint of real turtle? Just
answer me that, Mr. Orchardson.”</p>

<p>“Well, no,” replied my uncle, looking at her with surprise;
“I never heard that turtle was for any but Lord Mayors. Kit
has had everything regardless of expense, that our skilful Dr.
Sippets recommended him. Perhaps you know better than he
does, Miss Parslow. And the bottles of stuff, every two hours
day and night, with half a pint rubbed in at frequent intervals,
till he groans, and that shows that it has acted on his system.”</p>

<p>“System indeed! There is no system in it, except to kill
him, in spite of the Parslow constitution. The roads are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
soft, but I shall send for him to-morrow, with a proper close
carriage and a pair of horses. And if you try to prevent it, let
his death lie at your door.”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt,” said my uncle, after some consideration,
“that your house is much warmer, and better fitted up
than this with warm baths, and all that which he ought to have.
And Sippets said that change of air would be a great thing for
him. I will see him, before you go away, and if he thinks it
would be safe, let it be so, ma’am. But you must not suppose
that I have grudged him anything. And a very pretty bill
there will be for me to pay.”</p>

<p>Miss Chalker meanwhile had made a great discovery, to wit
that she had never seen Hampton Court; and Sam Henderson,
who happened to come in to ask for me, found out that he had
business there that very afternoon. So after dining with my
uncle, off they set together, and Miss Parslow undertook to call
for her companion upon her way back to Leatherhead. Sam
had gone up several pages in Mr. Orchardson’s good books, by
his rescue of me, and even more by his refusal of the handsome
reward which he might have claimed for it. And now there
were very few days when he did not come down, and offer
counsel, and perhaps bring a hare or rabbit. And my uncle
liked his stories of the lords and ladies, even when he was
unable to believe them.</p>

<p>“Now, I am not going home without a little talk with you,”
said Aunt Parslow to her host, when the young couple had
made off; “I must be rude enough to ask you just to spare me
a little time. And I don’t think you can do much on the
ground just now. It must be quite unfit to work, after all the
snow and thaw, and rain again coming on the top of it. And
the land must be so cold that the spring will be very
late. You see I know a little about gardening, too. Will you
try to spare me half an hour, as I can come so seldom?”</p>

<p>“I am always at the service of the ladies, however busy I
may be.” My uncle’s answer was truly polite, but not so
true in other points. “The spring will be very late, and therefore
summer will find us all behind. I mean, if we get any
summer at all.”</p>

<p>“It is quite as likely that we shall not, and that makes it
unwise of us to be in any hurry. Mr. Orchardson, you have a
special gift of never being in a hurry. We women always
envy that way of taking things, because we cannot hope to
attain to it. You know what we are, don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“All that is delightful, ma’am; so far as I have had any
opportunity of learning. And all that is reasonable, whenever
there is nothing particular to interfere with it. I assure you
that I have the highest respect for—for the way that you
generally go on.”</p>

<p>“You pay me a very high compliment, sir, and I wish that
we all deserved it. But I am sure you will admit that I
am reason itself, in asking you one or two little questions.
There was a little money that fell in, as a sort of windfall, or
whatever you call it, to my niece, the mother of this unlucky
Kit. I scarcely know what the exact sum was, though of
course I could easily find out. But it must have been about
two thousand pounds. I believe that it came into your possession
as his next of kin, but in trust for him of course. And I
conclude that as he has long been of age, you have handed it over
to Kit himself.”</p>

<p>“Not I, ma’am;” cried my uncle, who was as honest as
the day. “That would have been the worst thing that I could
do. I have told him of it several times, and strongly recommended
him to let me apply it for his benefit. Kit is a
sensible and upright fellow, and he knows when he is in good
hands, that he does; and he is capable of managing his own
affairs, without anybody’s interference.”</p>

<p>“Without even his uncle’s?” asked Miss Parslow, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; and without even his great-aunt’s,” Mr. Orchardson
answered, with a frown.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that you have acted for the best;” the
lady returned, for she wished to do no harm, and saw that it
would cost me more than two thousand pounds to have Uncle
Corny set against me. “And it is the best thing that could
have happened to him, to come into his capital when he wants
it, without having had a chance of making any hole in it. I
dare say he has not the least idea what it is. It will be a
nice little nest egg, when he wants a nest.”</p>

<p>“I have never let him know how much it is, and I do not
mean to tell him, till I hand it over. I have never touched a
penny of it, my dear madam; which I never would have told
you, if you had shown a doubt of me. I have allowed it to
accumulate at four per cent.; and the sum is now three
thousand five hundred pounds, which will be transferred into
the name of Kit, on the day that he marries Miss Fairthorn. I
should have thought myself justified in deducting the twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
pounds reward, for his stupidity in losing himself in the
snow; but Mr. Henderson will not accept it. I have kept Kit
from a baby, and he was dreadful with his clothes, and broke
the backs of nearly all the books he had at school. But I shall
not charge him sixpence, ma’am. He has worked well for me,
and he can lay in a tree very nearly as well as I can.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Orchardson, you are a gentleman,” cried my aunt,
much impressed with the increase of money; “and I would
ask you as a favour, in return for my inquiries, to allow me to
discharge Dr. Sippet’s account.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, Miss Parslow, for it will be very stiff, and
the uphill time of the year is before me. I do not pretend to
be a gentleman, madam; but I should not be a man if I wronged
my brother’s baby. The only thing I ask you is to keep this
from Kit’s knowledge, and leave me to tell him at my own
time. I have hinted to him once or twice that he has something
coming; but if I were to tell him he would go and tell
his Kitty, and I wish it to be kept from all that lot.”</p>

<p>“He shall not know a word of it through me, I can assure
you. And I shall consider what I can do for them. But the
first thing is to set him on his legs again.”</p>

<p>At this very moment, I was being set by a happy little
accident upon my legs, as well as enjoying a delight which no
money (at the finest compound interest) can insure. In the
corner of the room which my aunt had so decried, and where I
had passed so many miserable weeks, an old wooden bracket
with three little shelves was nailed against the yellow-ochred
wall. I had often cast my weary eyes in that direction, and
vaguely watched a spider, who was in a doleful plight, with
his legs drawn together, and no stomach left between them;
such a time was it since he had tasted a good fly. On the
bottom shelf were bottles of a loathsome disposition, pill-boxes
and galley-pots, and measures no less repulsive to good taste;
on the middle shelf lay my mother’s Prayer-book, and some
papers of directions, and orders, and powders and the like;
but what was on the top shelf I could not tell, and had often
wondered languidly in the wanderings of hazy speculation.
And I might have been content to wonder still, without any
guide-post of interest, if I had not heard Miss Parslow say—“Ah,
that would do him a lot more good than those,” as she
pointed to the top shelf, and then to the others.</p>

<p>For a time I forgot all about it, and fell into a little sleep of
indifference; but being aroused by the sound of plates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
dishes and the clinking of glasses down below, I longed to
know what they were having for dinner, and what was the joke
they were laughing at. Then a lovely smell of something came
into the room, and my head went round with the effort of
searching itself for the name of that fragrance, although it was
nothing but fried calf’s liver, with which Mrs. Tapscott was
skilful. “Shall I ever have that again, instead of filthy nastiness?”
was all that I had sense enough to want to know; and
then I thought somehow of the starving spider, and looked to
ask whether he was dead yet.</p>

<p>Not only was he not dead, but clearly (after seeing rain once
more upon the window-panes) he had made up his mind that
life was worth living, and a little activity might make it more
so. Where he got his stuff from is more than I can tell, for
any man would have vowed that his meagre body could never
have supplied him with the hundredth part of the dreamiest
film of a gossamer. However, he knew his own business best,
and he was at it, as if he were paid by the piece.</p>

<p>Being hungry myself, I could sympathize with him, while
detesting his bloodthirstiness, as every man must who lives on
beef and mutton. And I saw that he was scheming to attach
his tent cords to a coign of great vantage on the top shelf of the
bracket.</p>

<p>“When spiders go thrumming, there is wild weather
coming,” came clumsily into my half-saved mind; and then
floated into it, like a gossamer adrift, those mysterious words of
Aunt Parslow. Like the spider, I desired to be on the move,
and partly perhaps through the very same cause—the yearning
for a wholesome bit of flesh. At any rate, being left all alone,
for the resources of the establishment were at full pressure upon
hospitality, I resolved to know what was on that shelf, though
it might be my destiny to perish in the attempt.</p>

<p>This was not at all an easy job for a fellow who had spent
two months on his back; and my weakness amazed me, when
I tried to walk, and I seemed to be twice my own proper
length. Then I burst into a laugh at my own condition, and
tried to move a little chair to help me get along, but found it
made of lead, and had to coast around it. My sense of distance
also was entirely thrown out, for the room was quite a little one,
and yet it seemed a gallery. At last by some process of sprawling
and crawling I laid hold of the corner bracket, and lifting
myself with some difficulty, contrived to grasp all that was on
the top shelf. A little pile of letters was in my right hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and a light shot into my eyes, and a gleam of soft warmth
flowed into my heart.</p>

<p>Then I crawled back to my narrow bed, so nearly exchanged
for a narrower, and laid my treasure on my shrunken breast,
and turned on my side, that it might not slide away. I felt as
if there were two Kits now—one who knew nothing about it,
and the other who wanted it all to himself. And perhaps that
other Kit was Kitty.</p>

<p>How long I continued in this crazed condition, it is impossible
for me to say; but as sure as the goodness of God is
with us, it saved my reason and my life. For by-and-by, a
warmth of blood flowed through me, and a sense of being in a
large sweet world; then memory awoke, and pain was gone,
and I was like a little child looking at its mother. I did not
read a word, nor care to read; but I knew whose hand was on
my heart, and I would not disturb it by a stir of thought, but
was satisfied with it, for it was everything. And so I fell into
a long deep sleep; and when I awoke, I was a man again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<small>OUT OF ALL REASON.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Worse</span> troubles than those of the troublesome body were
visiting one worth a thousand of me. Captain Fairthorn was
still in Scotland, while his fair daughter was being worried, as
a lamb among playful wolves. Without any aid her step-mother
was enough to supply her with constant misery; but
even her malice was more easy to endure than the insolent
attentions of two vile men. To these the poor girl was exposed
every day; for if she took refuge in her own room, she was
bodily compelled to come down again, and her gentle appeals
and even strong disdain were treated as a child’s coquetry.
There are few things more truculent to a woman, even a very
young one, than the jocular assumption that she does not know
her mind, and perhaps has little of that article to know. Sir
Cumberleigh Hotchpot proceeded regularly upon that assumption;
and though Kitty had the sweetest temper ever bestowed
as a blessing to the owner and all around, this foregone conclusion
and heavenly pity (from a creature by no means celestial)
drove her sometimes towards the tremulous line which severs
sanity from insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>For it has been said, and perhaps with truth, that the
largest and soundest of human minds could not remain either
large or sound, if all the other minds it had to deal with
combined to pronounce it both small and unsound. Under the
hostile light, it could not save itself from shrinking; it would
glance about vainly for a gleam to suit its own, and then
straighten to a line with a cross at either end, like the pupil of
a cat in the fierce light of the sun.</p>

<p>Left in this manner without any friends, with her heart
and her soul among lions, my Kitty (although of strong
substance) began to doubt whether there is any justice. Good
as she was, and clear and truthful, and possessing that sense—which
is now turned into folly by higher discoveries—of a
guiding power beyond our own, she strove to believe that no
harm could touch her, while she continued blameless. But it
was a fearful battle for a timid maiden to have to fight.</p>

<p>Happily both for herself and me, her enemies, before they
got her down, fell out about their lawful prey. When Donovan
Bulwrag joined the hunt, at first he was content to turn the
quarry towards the other hounds, and enjoy the distress unselfishly.
But after a while, like an eager dog, he began to
kindle towards the prey, and shot forth jealous glances, and
resolved to have a nip for his own tooth. So far as such a
hound could care for anything outside his own hide, he became
enamoured of the charming chase.</p>

<p>His mother with her quick malignant eyes perceived it,
and was furious. Her pet scheme was that her sweet Downy,
her Golden Downy as she called him, should marry gold, and
succeed to the title—which was not improbable—restore its
impoverished glory, and set her on high triumphant. Then her
proud sister at Halliford would come and sue to be reconciled,
and her daughters with the lovely hair would shine and marry
fortunes. She would cast the Professor and his grimy works
behind her, and reign as she deserved to reign.</p>

<p>In furtherance of this lofty plan, she had already chosen
for her son a most desirable helpmate, a lady of good birth,
and yet sufficiently akin with commerce to redden her blue
blood with gold. And a very quiet harmless girl, who would
gladly fill the chest with guineas, and hand the key to her
mother-in-law. To be a step-mother to gentleness had been a
pleasant and refreshing task; but to be the mother-in-law of
wealth would afford even finer occasions of delight. She had
always been proud of her son’s strong will, and resolute knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of his own mind, while they moved in the course she had
marked for them; but if they went astray, they must be
crushed. With her usual promptitude she resolved to bring
the matter to a point at once.</p>

<p>Downy had arrived at the same determination. He had no
idea of doing what he disliked, and his mother had told him
that she meant to call upon Lady Clara Voucher (the only
child and heiress of the Earl of Clerinhouse), and expected his
company that afternoon in the carriage she had bought, but
not paid for. “Very well,” he had said, “we will talk about
it;” for his sisters were present, and he preferred a single
combat.</p>

<p>Knowing that his mother was now alone, he came into the
room with his quiet heavy tread, and sat down, and crossed his
legs, and looked at her. Downy Bulwrag, even while he was
a boy, had been able to earn a large competence of hatred; as
a young man he had increased the stock, and throve upon it,
and fattened on the butterine of his own slimy fame. Good
and simple young fellows of his own age disliked him, from
what they had heard of him; but none had the power to hate
him properly, until they had seen him. But after that they
knew what to do. They spat on the ground when they thought
of him.</p>

<p>“What is it, Downy?” asked his mother, unwarily surrendering
the weather-gage of silence. “You look as if something
had put you out. I think it is I who have the right to
be put out.”</p>

<p>Downy began to roll a cigarette—that ragged mummy of the
great king Nicot, which was then just beginning to cast its
dirty ash about. He wetted his fingers with a little sharp
smack of his lips, but made no answer.</p>

<p>“You will not smoke here,” cried his mother, already discarding
the superior maternal tone; “I never let your father
smoke in my presence; and I am sure I shall never let a boy
like you.”</p>

<p>“Who was going to smoke?” asked Downy, with gruff
contempt at this instance of feminine precipitance.</p>

<p>“You may smoke, by-and-by, when you have a house of
your own, and a dear little wife to spoil you. But you are
coming with me to see her, and you must not smell of tobacco
yet. For a short time you must be on your best behaviour.
Not that sweet Clara would ever object to anything you like,
my dear; but that others might take advantage of it, to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
you seem less devoted to her than you are. She is the great
catch of the season, you know, and there are so many young
men after her. She will make the best wife any man could
have—so pleasant, and amiable, and accomplished, and in spite
of that so sweetly pretty. When I saw her, the night before
last at Lady Indigo’s, I thought I had never seen any one so
charming.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of her good looks.”</p>

<p>“Then you are most ungrateful, for she dotes on you. Her
dear friend, the Countess, said—‘Tell your noble Downy not
to be frightened by sweet Clara’s money. Her heart is entirely
his. What a lucky fellow!’ And then she sighed, for a
little plan of hers has been quite upset by this romantic episode.
Oh, you are fortunate indeed, my dear; and perhaps a
little credit may be fairly due to me. Now put on the coat
with the sable trimmings. You look so foreign, and distinguished
in it. And it shows your broad chest in such a
striking way. That dear Countess said that it made her quite
jealous about her dowdy countrymen. And she thought it had
something to do with your conquest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to go at all.” The dutiful son, as he pronounced
these words, threw his bulky shoulders back, and
planted one big elbow on the arm of his easy-chair, and gazed
calmly through his yellow lashes, smiling slightly as he watched
the colour rising on his mother’s dark face. He knew that two
stern wills were coming into clash; and the victory would be
for the one that did not waste itself in fury.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me,” began the lady, trembling at
heart, and her voice becoming tremulous, “that you intend
to throw away all I have done? That you will not marry Lady
Clara Voucher?”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I do mean. I will never marry Lady
Clara Voucher.”</p>

<p>“And why? Perhaps you will condescend to give some
reason.”</p>

<p>“I mean to marry some one else. I mean to marry Kitty
Fairthorn.”</p>

<p>His mother arose, as she generally did, when her furious
temper burst all bonds. Often enough, and too often, she had
been in a tempest of wild passion; but never till now in such
a hurricane of rage. At first she was stilled by her own
commotion; and the lines of her face twitched as with palsy.</p>

<p>“Tell me again,” she said, crossing her arms, and speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with great effort, as she stood before him, and he sat tranquil;
“I cannot believe it, till I have heard it twice.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, ma’am, to oblige you. I mean to marry, not
Lady Clara, but your step-daughter, Kitty.”</p>

<p>“You ninny, you rebel, you stubborn doll!” she had usually
a fine store of these expressions, but they seemed to desert her
in this great need, and he nodded his head at every one, as if
to say, “Try something better than that”—“You—But it is
useless; you are too base to care, you sit there, like a lump of
yellow jaundice. Do you think that a beautiful girl like Kitty—the
vile, designing, artful minx; I will throttle her, I wish
I had her here. Go and fetch her, bring her to me; I don’t
blame you. But she shall pay for this, with her life she shall.
If they hang me to-morrow—”</p>

<p>“Come, mother, come. You have let off a good bit of steam
already. You’ll be as right as a trivet, after a few more choice
expressions. Don’t spare them, if they do you good, you know.”</p>

<p>“I shall never be right again. My heart is broken. I
feel myself dying, and you have killed me. You, my own son,
have murdered me. Oh, good God! What is this pain?”</p>

<p>She fell upon the floor, and moaned and gasped, pressing
both hands to her leaping heart, and scared of all wrath by the
dread of death; now and then she muttered prayers for mercy,
broken with groans of agony. Downy was terrified, and ran
for brandy, as she began to tear her hair, and clutch at the
carpet, with shrieks growing weaker and more gurgling. And
as he ran back, his sister Euphrasia met him, and snatched the
bottle from his hand.</p>

<p>“You have done it,” cried Frizzy; “I knew you would.
One of these days she’ll kill herself. You go away. You’re
not wanted here. She wouldn’t take it from your hand, to
save her life. I knew it must come. Get away, get away.
Don’t let her eyes hit upon you, when she rolls them; or she
will go off worse than ever. She knows everything, when she
is insensible.”</p>

<p>“Well, you women are a cure!” said Downy, recovering his
strength of mind. “I shall go to my own room, and have a
cigar. You can come and tell me, when she is all right.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that she will ever be all right,” said his
sister, desiring to frighten him; “I have never seen her quite
so bad as this.”</p>

<p>But he only answered, “What a funk you are! She shall
not beat me, with all this stuff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>He had very little conscience, and that little—to use a
stock-word now in fashion—particularly <i>reticent</i>. And the
still small voice, if there were any, could not find much to say
this time. In nothing but the rudeness of his manner had he
offended against strict right, and he never even knew when his
manner was rude, because it was his nature. He could not help
having a passionate mother, who flew into a fury when her
plans were crossed. So he smoked his cigar, and considered his
next step.</p>

<p>It was plain to him now, without need of thought—for he
was not good enough to be a fool—that something decisive
might be done at once. He knew what his mother was too well,
to suppose that any arguments of his, or any regard for his
feelings, would ever induce her to consent to his marriage with
Kitty Fairthorn. And he knew that Kitty did not like him
(although he had never ill-used her), and in her old-fashioned
way would regard the relation of their parents towards one
another as a bar to any marriage between them. And he knew
that her money, through her father’s neglect, had been placed
out of her disposal. But in spite of all obstacles, he meant to
have her, and her money afterwards.</p>

<p>Up to the present time, he had feigned to be the ally of Sir
Cumberleigh Hotchpot, and to forward his suit very warmly.
At the same time he had contrived to earn some gratitude from
Kitty, and to make her look upon him as her friend in need,
by flying to her rescue now and then, and sometimes even
carrying off her too insistent suitor. This he had been doing
more and more, as his passion increased, and jealousy combined
with pity on her behalf. Thoroughly despising the older
villain, for his shallowness more than his villainy, he began to
hate him also for his insolence to the fair one. Having now
declared his own intentions, he must put a stop to all that stuff.</p>

<p>While he was thinking much more of these things than of his
injured mother, he heard a gentle but hurried knock at his
door, and in came Kitty. She was trembling and flushed, with
some excitement, and her beautiful hair was disarranged.</p>

<p>“Oh, Donovan,” she cried, for she never called him
“Downy.” “I have heard that your mother is very ill, and
they are quite alarmed about her. Sarah came in such a hurry
for some bottle of my father’s; but I was afraid to let her have
it, for they have no idea how to use it. Don’t you think you
had better run for Doctor Yallop? They won’t let me in to
ask them, and I am afraid to go for him without orders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Kitty, no. It is nothing more than usual. She would
never see the doctor, if he came; and it would only set her off
again. Frizzy knows best how to manage her. She has been in a
great wax, even for her; and she is just a bit frightened, as she
ought to be. It will do her a world of good, when she comes
round, and teach her to take things easier. But you look quite
startled, my dear child. Give me a kiss, and I will tell you all
about it.”</p>

<p>Kitty obeyed, though with some reluctance. One of her
many charms was obedience, and she had often been told in
the early days, that as they were now one family, to exchange
the friendly salute was proper. But lately she had been
surprised that Downy, after long indifference to its value, had
returned to this form of expressing esteem.</p>

<p>The young man had meant to defer for a while a declaration
which must be unwelcome at first. But he felt sure now that
the first thing his mother would do, as soon as she was well
enough, would be to fall on the poor maiden about it, and put
it in the most outrageous way. Much better for his cause that
he should speak of it himself, and win perhaps some credit for
his defiance of Kitty’s natural foe. He was always bold in
word and deed, and now he spoke with as little fear as grace.</p>

<p>“You must have seen, my dear, that lately I have been
growing very fond of you. You have seen that I always take
your part when people go to bully you. And why do you
suppose I do it? Why, because I am so fond of you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Donovan. I have often thanked you in my
mind, though not in words. Placed as we are, it is quite right
that we should be fond of one another.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean that sort of thing at all. My mother
married your Governor; but that would only make it natural
that we should hate one another. And there is no love lost
between you and Frizzy, or Jerry either, so far as that goes.
What I mean is that I am fond of you, as—as a fellow is of
his sweetheart. And I mean to marry you, indeed I do, as
soon—why, as soon as you like almost.”</p>

<p>Poor Kitty looked at him, as if he must be joking; or if it
were not that, he must have taken too much wine, as he did
sometimes, especially when he had been much with Sir
Cumberleigh.</p>

<p>“How provoking you are, Kitty! There, sit down. You
will get used to the idea in about five minutes. Why, there’s
nothing surprising in it, I should think. Though you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
have thought that I was looking higher. But I have always
had my own peculiar views. I can do without money, and
rank, and all that. And I have taken a real fancy to you.
This is enough to prove it, don’t you think? Give us your
flipper, as that old rogue says; for I mean business, upon my
word I do. And I fancy it won’t stick too much in your gizzard,
that the old woman rages, like a tiger, against it.”</p>

<p>“I can scarcely believe that you mean this. It is utterly
impossible; I don’t know how people take such things; but
to me it is simply horrible. Never speak of it again, if you
wish me to speak to you. Promise me never to speak of it
again.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Settle it so, if you like. At any rate, for
the present. You have got hold of some queer ideas, I suppose.
High Church crotchets, or some such rubbish. You will come
to think better of it, by-and-by.”</p>

<p>“And by the holy poker, she shall be glad to do so,” he
muttered to himself when she was gone; “We will try a bold
stroke, my pretty dear; and you shall come on your knees to
me, to marry you.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

<small>A FINE TIP.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> were many worse men in the world even then—and the
number increases with population—than the gallant Sir Cumberleigh
Hotchpot. The principal source of the evil in him was
that he knew not wrong from right. If he could have seen
the difference, he might have been tempted by the charms of
virtue; but as that pure lady had never found her way into
his visiting list, it would be unfair to blame him for neglecting
her. He came of good family—in one sense—and a very bad
family, in another. For several generations, the Hotchpots
had verified their names, by making mixture of all moral
doctrine. And the air of a county, where the world is flat and
oozy, may have helped to bring high and low to one dead level.</p>

<p>That speculation is beyond the mark; though as everything
is material now, it may justly be accepted in plea for him.
What is more to the purpose, and less of problem, is the plain
truth that evil blood was in his veins, and there had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
been anything to purify it. In his early days, the influence
of a strong, clear-headed, and resolute wife, lifting him into
self-respect, and sweetening his paltry bitterness, might have
saved him from his vile contempt, and made a decent man of
him. And such a chance had once been his; but he cast it by
through his own foul conduct, and it never came again. The
lady married a better man, who was able to lead her, as well
as be led; and the man she had escaped made a bitter grievance
of his own miscarriage.</p>

<p>Now, he was one of that wretched lot—the elderly rakes,
without faith in women, respect for themselves, or trust in God.
Even the coarser advantages of life, the vigorous health, the
good-will of the world, the desire to rise, the power of wealth—all
these had failed him; and he was left with nothing but a
feverish thirst for excitement, and a dreary desire to say spiteful
things, which his meagre wit seldom gratified.</p>

<p>For this he was hated by Downy Bulwrag, who also
despised him for aping the vices which are so much easier to
youth. However, it was Downy’s object now to ingratiate himself
with this “old party;” and Downy had long acquired the
art of quenching his sentiments in his object. So he took a
cab, that very night, when his mother’s hysterics were drowned
in Cognac, and presented himself at Sir Cumberleigh’s house,
in a small square of South Kensington. He had not been
encouraged to call here often; for the Baronet (who generally
misplaced his shame) was shy of the fact that he had let the
better part of his house to a fashionable artist, while he
occupied the smaller rooms himself. The visitor found him
just returned from his club, and by no means in an amiable
frame of mind, for the cards had been adverse, and he could
ill afford to lose. And he did not scruple to show his annoyance,
at this late and unexpected call.</p>

<p>But Downy drew an easy-chair near the fire, gave a kick to
the Hotchpot terrier (who with sound instinct had made a dash
at him), and spread his fat legs along the fender, without saying
a word, till his host had done the grumbles. And he had his
revenge in his own crafty way, for he gazed round the room,
noting everything, and lifting his yellow eyebrows now and then,
or pursing up his big lips, and stroking his moustache, as if he
were conning how much—or rather how little, the pictures,
and furniture, would fetch.</p>

<p>“Been any auctioneers in your family?” Sir Cumberleigh’s
temper was never very good, and this appraisement of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
chattels made it very bad indeed. His intention had been to
have a quiet smoke, and his nip or two of cordial by the fire,
while he went through his tablets by the latest lights. He had
thrown off his wig, to cool his brain, and had no time to clap
it on again. Frank and cheerful baldness is no disgrace to any
man, and sometimes adds a crown of goodness to a pleasant
face; but this gentleman had not that reward of gentle life;
and his bulbous pate, when naked, was what ladies call
“horrid.” His restless and suspicious eyes, and sneering
mouth with lines that looked as if nature had constructed
channels for the drainage of foul words, and the sour crop of
blotches on his welted cheeks, were more than enough to
countervail expansive brow, and noble dome of curls, if there
had been any. There were none; and even Downy Bulwrag
thought—“What a bridegroom for a lovely girl!”</p>

<p>“You are inclined to cut up rough, old boy;” said Bulwrag,
after listening long to much that never should be listened
to. “Something disagreed with you? It must be so, as we get
on in life. Well, tell me, when you are certain that you have
done exploding. No hurry. Pleasure first; business afterwards.”</p>

<p>Sir Cumberleigh carried on a little more with his condemnation
of all mankind, just to show that he was not at all
impressed with this aspect of the younger man. Then his
temper prevailed, as the other kept quiet; and he said—“Out
with your business, if there is any!”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it matters much to you. You are rolling
in money, after going down to your audit, and all that sort of
thing. You might like to invest a cool five hundred in a loan
to me, at five per cent. Do it, and earn my everlasting gratitude.”</p>

<p>“You have something good to tell me, or to put me up to.
Upon my soul, Bulwrag, I shall be glad to know it. I have
three bills falling due to-morrow. I am on my last legs, and
that makes me so grumpish.”</p>

<p>“You have been uncommonly grumpish, Pots; and I am
not at all sure that I shall tell you anything. I like to do a
kindness to a friend; but you hardly seem to be quite that,
just now.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you never go by words. You have seen
too much of the world for that. The real friend is the man
who shows you his rough side. I do that to you, Downy,
because I like you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you can’t have much left for your enemies, my
friend. But my rule is to take things as I find them, and the
same is the golden rule, according to the law and prophets. I
will render good for evil, Pots; I will tell you of a nice little
windfall for you, if you have the pluck to keep up with
luck.”</p>

<p>“Downy, I am up for anything. All has been against me
for the last ten days, and I should like to have my revenge of
it. It would take a big fence to pound me.”</p>

<p>“There’s a big pot of money the other side,” said Downy,
counting slowly on his fingers; “eighteen and sixteen make
thirty-four, and twelve makes forty-six, and Chilian eight
thousand four hundred, with the market down, should be
worth another twelve, when they go up. But put it at present
quotations, and you have between fifty-four and fifty-five
thousand pounds, payable on the nail, and no trustees. It
would come in pretty well to start with, Pots, after paying the
fellows that know no better. And you might lend me the odd
four thousand upon good security. I would give you eight per
cent., old fellow, and pay you like a church.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Downy? Or are you trying hocus? Nothing
of that sort ever comes my way now. I have been on the
wrong horse ever since last Goodwood. And now again at
Lincoln. Those cursed tips have tipped me over.”</p>

<p>“It has nothing to do with turf, or tips. What do you
think of our little Kitty coming into sixty thousand pounds, for
it’s worth every penny of that, they say, and nobody to look
after it, but the lucky cove that marries her?”</p>

<p>“Sweet Kitty! My sweet Kitty Fairthorn; I adore her
for her own sake, without a crooked sixpence. But it sounds
too good to be true, my boy. Take a suck, and tell us all about
it.”</p>

<p>“The beauty of it is that she doesn’t know a word of
it;” Bulwrag began to unfold his roll of fiction very recklessly,
which gave it the crackle and flash of truth. “And if we can
keep her in the dark, for another ten days or fortnight, why, a
bit of pluck and gumption, and there the job is done! You
know that my excellent mother considers it one of her strictest
duties to open all the letters that come to the house for the
younger and feminine branches. She keeps the key of the
letter-box, and no one else is allowed to go near it. When I
first came back, she began to open mine; but I stopped that,
quick sticks, I can tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“She is a strong party, and no mistake. I hope she won’t
want to come and cock over my crib, when I am spliced to the
heavenly Kitty. I should get the wrong side of the sixty thousand
pounds.”</p>

<p>“Well, this morning there came a little billet for our
Kitty, sealed, and got up, and looking no end confidential.
The Ma wasn’t going to stand that, of course; it set up her
hackles that any one should try it. She took it to her own
room, and found it so important that it was not right to let the
owner know a word about it, at least until the subject had been
well considered. But she called me into council, and my advice
was to keep it dark, and make the most of it. And here is all
there is of it.</p>

<p>“It seems that the old scientific bloke had a sister in the
wilds of Northumberland, to whom he gave fearful offence,
years ago, by blowing her cat up, or something of that sort, and
she vowed he should never have sixpence of hers. But being
better off for cash than kindred, which is not the usual state of
things, she has left all her belongings to his daughter, straight
away, in the lump, with nothing to pay but duty. Her father
will be her trustee by law, I suppose, until she is of age or
marries. But if she marries, without having it settled, which
her father of course would insist upon, why, there you are—the
happy man is master of the money, though she may go
in for a post-nuptial, or what ever they call it, kind of settlement.”</p>

<p>“Downy, my boy, it sounds too good to be true,” said Sir
Cumberleigh, looking at him doubtfully, but the young man’s
great bulky face and round forehead were as tranquil as an
orange; “who are the lawyers? It came, of course, from the
old lady’s men of law. Was it a London or a country firm? I
don’t want to be too inquisitive, you know. But in a manner
of this sort—”</p>

<p>“The less you know the better, so long as you are convinced.
You were eager to marry the girl without a penny; and what
motive can I have for deceiving you? In fact, I think I have
been a fool to tell you. We could let her get the money, and
what chance would you have then? Plenty of young swells,
with rhino of their own, would be after such a pretty girl with
sixty thousand pounds. And I will tell you two things, since
you seem to doubt me. In the first place, I shall insist upon
ten thou. advanced upon my note of hand at five per cent.
And again for your comfort, my mother since she heard of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
won’t hear another word of you, beloved Pots, unless I can
bring her round to it. She would naturally prefer a young soft
fellow, with a fine place of his own, where she can go and
govern, when she wants a little change, as she governs everywhere.
So that will be all you get, old chap, by doubting
yours truly. Good-night, my boy. I am sorry that I ever
told you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so hot, my friend. I never doubted you. All
that I doubted was my own good luck. And upon my soul,
Downy, if you had had such luck as I have, you would never
place any more faith in it. Here, my dear fellow, have a Don
Pintolado; there’s not such another weed to be got in London.
And here’s a rare drop of old brandy, such as perhaps you
never tasted. It’s as old as the hills, and as soft as oil. You
must never put a drop of water with it. It stands me in two
hundred and forty shillings a dozen, and I have never let any
one see it but myself. What do you think of that now? Roll
it on your tongue. The best liquor you ever nosed is not a
patch upon it. You are a good judge, give me your opinion.”</p>

<p>“I never tasted anything like it, Pots. Where the devil
do you get it from?”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’ll put you up to that some day. But now let us
have a little quiet chat. You need not be afraid of it. Have
another glass. You see I always take it in a very thin dock-glass,
made on purpose for it. If it had not been for that I
should have gone to the dogs long ago with all my troubles.
However, let us hope for an end of them soon. Fifty thou.
would set me straight, and I could get back the old place, and
give up fast life, and turn quiet Country Squire. It is time for
me to get out of all this racket, and stick to one or two solid
friends like you. Now tell me, old chap, exactly what I am
to do. I’ll give you any undertaking you think fit. Only, of
course, we must keep it dark.”</p>

<p>“Ah, and not be in any over-hurry;” Donovan Bulwrag
breathed rings of blue serenity from the grey-edged auricula of
his fine cigar, and then said slowly, “I remember some little
box you used to have, about two miles beyond Hounslow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I have got it still, because nobody would have
it. They wanted to turn it into a poultry-breeding place when
that craze was on, but they could not pay deposit. At any
rate they didn’t; and I have it still on hand.”</p>

<p>“All right. Have it aired. It will be very pretty, now
that the broom and all that is coming on again. In another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
week or so the nightingales will be about. Could you have a
snugger place on earth to pass your honeymoon in?”</p>

<p>“Twig,” said Sir Cumberleigh, “twig’s the word, with a
little quiet prodding, and a special license. But won’t she cut
up rough, my boy? We must not have abduction. It has
been done in my family; but the times were better then.”</p>

<p>“Kitty is not the one to cut up rough. My mother has
drilled her a lot too well for that. And if I come with her,
and you are not seen till the last, there can be no talk about
abduction. All little particulars must be left to me. You can let
me your crib, if it eases you down, and produce the agreement,
if there is any row. But there won’t be any row. You know
the rule with women—smoothe over everything, when the job
is done.”</p>

<p>“I should like to think over it a little, Downy. I am not
like a boy who has the world on his side, when he does a rash
thing in his passion. The world has been very hard on me,
God knows; and I am rather old to give it another slap in the
face. Why shouldn’t I marry the charming Kitty, with her
mother’s consent, and all done in proper trim? Then we could
go down to my old house, and have bonfires, and bells, and
roast an ox, and all that. And she could have a settlement,
why not? My lawyers could do it, so as to leave me the tin?”</p>

<p>“Try it on that way, if you like. How can it matter to me,
beloved Potts? There are two little stodges for you to get
over. Would Kitty ever look at you if she knew she had this
money? And my mother will not hear of you, since she saw
that letter.”</p>

<p>“That devil of a woman!” cried the other rather rudely,
forgetting that her son received the statement of the fact.
“She has always had her own way, and she always will.
Thank God that she never married me. Perhaps she would
have done it if she had seen me soon enough. If she has turned
against me it is all up, without some such lay as yours, my
boy. Not a dog can tuck his ear up without her knowing
why. You could never get your sister down there, without
her knowing it.”</p>

<p>“She is not my sister,” said Downy very hotly; “or do you
think I would let her marry such a man as you? But the
devil of a woman, as you politely call her, goes down to my Grandfather
in Wales next week, and takes my two sisters with her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then the coast will be clear, my dear boy! That
makes all the difference. You might have told me that, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
an hour ago. I see my way out of it now, clear enough. The
main point will be to keep the country lawyers quiet.
Unless they get an answer to their letter pretty sharp, they’ll
be sending up a junior partner, or their London agent, for
fear of some other lawyer’s finger in the pie. That would
upset your pot. How are you to help it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing easier. For a few days at any rate. And that is
why the job must be tackled pretty smart. We shall send an
acknowledgment in Kitty’s name to-morrow, saying that she
wishes to consult her father’s lawyers—name of the firm of course
omitted—from whom Messrs. So-and-so will hear very shortly;
and that will keep them quiet for a bit. Those fellows make a
point of never hurrying one another.”</p>

<p>“Capital! I know what they are too well. By-the-bye,
did you tell me the name of the gang in Northumberland? I
might make a note of it. Though I must not let them guess
that I have heard of them, of course.”</p>

<p>“You would cut your own throat, if you did, Pots. I can
tell you, if you like, and get the letter perhaps to show you.
But you had better be able to swear, if there should be any
rumpus, that you had never so much as heard of them. And
then, if you were pressed, you might admit that you had heard
some vague rumour, but paid no attention to it, as it came from
a source you had very little faith in.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I could swear that without much harm.
Don’t show me the letter; I don’t want to see it. Have
another drop of this wonderful stuff. It wouldn’t hurt a child.
It is as soft as milk.”</p>

<p>“No, not a drop. I am too late as it is. You had better
keep away from our place for the present. It would not be so
well for you to receive the sack, you see, before the great stroke
comes off, next week. And the mother might be apt to administer
it, in her hasty way, you know. Send a line to say you
have got a cold, or something. And then run down to the
cottage, and begin at once to get it into spick and span. I shall
come to you every night, and report progress. Sixty thousand
is a good stake to run for.”</p>

<p>“But when is it to be, Downy, when is it to be? My
nerves are not what they used to be. And I shall not get a
wink, till the race is pulled off.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you will, if you go in for hard work. How can I
tell the day, till I have seen the mother off? The sooner the
better, when she has made tracks. There’s an old buffer coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to see the house, and keep our Kitty in order. But I can do
what I like with her. She’s smashed taters after the real
thing. Be of good cheer, Pots; I should say next Wednesday,
or Thursday, would see you a reformed and happy character.
Ta, ta, and remember me in your prayers.”</p>

<p>“I say, Downy, just one little thing,” said Sir Cumberleigh,
recalling him with some hesitation. “You must not be
offended, old fellow; but I should be so much obliged, if you
would drop your habit of calling me ‘Pots’ so frequently. It
sounds so personal; although of course it has no application to
me as yet. Why, you might even do it before your sister,
and then it would be so—so unromantic. You see what
I mean; no offence, you know.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I won’t have her called my sister. She is no
sister of mine, nor in any way connected. If you call her my
sister any more, I shall look upon it as an insult.”</p>

<p>“A very great compliment, I should say,” Sir Cumberleigh
pondered, when his visitor was gone; “what the deuce makes
him get in such a wax about it? A fellow with such a batter-pudding
face might be proud to call such a girl his sister. Oh,
I see why it is, what a thick I must be! If she were his sister,
he would be ashamed to be a party to this little plant. I don’t
like the look of it, and that’s all about it. But such a poor
devil must not stick at trifles. Sixty thousand pounds would
set me on my legs again. And it is not to be had by lying
down and rolling. And the sweetest girl in London, too without
any cheek or high faluting. I can soon break her in to any
pace I choose. I am not a bad fellow, only so unlucky. If
this comes off, I’ll go to church every Sunday. But I’ll take
uncommon good care all the same that Master Johnny Dory
does not collar too much of the rhino. I hate that young fellow,
he is just like a yellow slug crawling in a mop.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<small>BASKETS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> are ever so many kinds of baskets used in Covent
Garden Market, some of good measure, and some of guess, and
some of luck altogether, like a Railway’s charges. They come
from every quarter of the globe; and the pensive public may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
be well pleased if it gets a quarter of its bargain. A bushel
may hold a peck more or less, according to the last jump made
upon it. The basket-makers are by no means rogues, because
the contents can make no difference to them. They turn out
strong ware, at a very high price, so many inches in width, and
so many in depth, according to tradition. Then they pat it,
and pitch it down, and paint the name upon it; and their business
ends, except to get their money. And of this they never
fail; for the grower, as a rule, grows honesty as his chief,
and often only crop. But after that basket’s virgin fill, how
many meretricious uses does it undergo! The poor grower,
who has paid half a crown for it, never uses it again perhaps,
until it is worn out, and comes back to him, with a shilling
demanded for his name; when it has spent all its prime in half
the shops and trucks of London. Here it has passed through a
varied course of fundamental changes, alternately holding
three pecks and five according to its use for sale or purchase.
At first it was gifted with a slightly incurved bottom, not such
a deep “kick” as a Champagne-bottle has—which Napoleon
III. vainly strove to abolish—but a moderate and decent
inward tendency. Here the rogue spies his vantage ground.
Before filling it for sale, he lays it flat upon its rim, mounts
upon the concave eternal, and with a few heavy jumps of both
heels produces a bold and lofty internal dome. Then he stuffs
up the cavity round the side with a tidy lot of hay, or leaves,
or paper, and lo you have three pecks as brave as any four!
But is he going to buy by that measure? He lays it firmly
upon its base, gets inside, and jumps with equal vigour. The
accommodating bottom becomes concave, and he brings home
five pecks running over into his bosom.</p>

<p>As honest producers, we know nothing of all this—except
by the mark of hobnails on our wicker, when it comes home
with no integrity left—our business is to fill our baskets, whenever
the Lord permits us, keeping the top fruit certainly not
worse than the bottom, for that would be Quixotic, but not a
bit better than human nature, and the artistic sense, demand
of us. And there have been few greater calumnies of recent
years—though the world grows more and more calumnious—than
to call my Uncle Orchardson “Corny the topper,” as if
he covered rubbish with a crown of red or gold! A topper he
was; but it was only thus—he topped all his customers in
honesty.</p>

<p>This explanation was necessary, and should have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
offered long ago. But I thought it as well to let people see
first from his character, as given by himself and me, that he
required no such vindication. If ever there was a man who
gave good change for sixpence, ay, and took good care to get
it, too, you will own it was my Uncle Corny.</p>

<p>However, he used for inferior fruit, such as windfalls, or
maggoty, or undersized stuff, a cheaper and commoner form of
basket, such as the dealers call “Sallies.” These are of no
especial measure, but hold on the average about half a bushel,
some of them much more, and some a little less, and there is
no name marked upon them. They come, for the most part,
with foreign fruit in them, and are often thrown by, when
emptied; and there are men about the market who collect these,
perhaps for nothing, or at any rate for very little, and sell them
to the fruit-growers, or the dealers, at prices which vary
according to their quality and the demand for them, etc. They
can often be had at a shilling a dozen, at which price they are
cheap for any use; and at times they are not to be got under
sixpence apiece, but perhaps the average is twopence. They
are deeper than baskets of measure, and not so wide, also made
of much lighter wicker, and often full of stubs inside, which
would never do for best or second fruit; in fact, they are like a
waste-paper basket, such as one often sees under a table.</p>

<p>When I had been gone, at least a fortnight, I should say—though
I could not be certain about dates just then—to my
Aunt Parslow’s at Leatherhead, my uncle having done all his
grafting by himself, for there always was some to do every
year, took a general look at his trees, and found that the buds
looked as promising as ever he had seen them. He was rather
surprised at this, not at all on account of the long hard winter,
but because of the very cold wet summer and autumn which
had preceded it. The trees would be full of unripe wood, and
sappy shoots shrivelled by the frost, and scurfy bark, and
perished boughs, and general discomfort, and sulkiness. At
least everybody said that was how they ought to be, and my
uncle had never contradicted them, preferring a little pessimism,
because it is always the safer side. And probably upon cold,
wet soils, all the evils predicted had succeeded, which would
make it all the better for the places where they failed. So
that my uncle, while sympathizing warmly with all his brother
growers in their bad look-out, shook his head about his own,
and smoked his pipe, and would not speak of his chickens,
much less count them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>But, when the sun began to get the upper hand of the days
again, and the spring was looking through the hedge and into
the hearts of the trees almost, and the earth seemed ready to
lift its breast, as a maiden does for her flowers to be fixed, and
every shrub that showed a leaf had got a bird to sing to it—for
a time, the best man found it hard to make the worst of everything;
and even the often frozen grower hoped not to be
frozen again this year. For the later an English fruit-tree is in
showing its white or pink challenge to the sky, the less is the
chance of unheavenly heaven descending with a white blow,
and smiting all to utter blackness. The ground had been
frozen to a depth of twenty inches by the rigour of enduring
frost; and after that the push of spring takes a long time to
get down the line.</p>

<p>“Tompkins,” said my uncle, who was poking about with a
spade, to kill snails in some Iris roots, for no sort of winter
makes much difference to a snail; drought in their breeding-time
is all they care for much—“Tompkins, it is high time to
be looking up our baskets. In another month, those fellows
will be sticking it on again.”</p>

<p>“That ’em will,” the long man replied. He was short of
tongue, as a very tall man, by some ordinance of Nature,
almost always is—perhaps because his fellow-creatures’ hats
have endangered it while it was tender.</p>

<p>“You had better go over and see old Wisk, at three-quarter
day to-morrow. You can have the tax-cart, and just
see what he has. He is bound to have a good stock now, after
all the long frost and snow, on hand. And he is pretty sure to
be hard up. In June he begins to grin at us. Get the figure
for bushels, and halfs, by the gross, but don’t order any, until
I know. But if he has picked up any Sallies, you might bring
a gross at a shilling a dozen. I will give you twelve shillings;
and I’ll be bound the old rogue will be glad of a bit of ready
money.”</p>

<p>“All right, governor.” Selsey Bill offered up one gaunt
knuckle to his hat, which had no brim to accept it; for he had
improved in sense of manners, since his wages were advanced.
He had been put on, when the days pulled out, to twenty
shillings a week, with a title, not conferred, but generally felt,
of foreman of the outdoor work. He had a shilling apiece for
his children now every week, and another for his wife, and two
to think about all Sunday. And my firm belief is that if he
could have earned another by wronging us, he would have
made the tempter swallow it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“But mind one thing,” said my uncle strongly, for he found
it ruinous to relax; “your wife’s brother I believe it is, that
keeps the <i>Crooked Billet</i> beyond the heath, not a hundred
yards from old Wisk’s place. You need not pull <i>Spanker</i> up,
to give Mrs. Tomkin’s love, you know.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, governor. What wicked things you do
put into a fellow’s head!” My uncle grinned, and so did Bill,
but with his long back turned, and his hand upon his spade.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon, Bill acted with the truest sense
of honour. As he approached the <i>Crooked Billet</i>, the wind (for
which he was not to blame) brought him the burden of a drawling
song, drawled as only a Middlesex man—who can beat all
the North and even West at that—can troll his slow emotions
forth. “Oh, I would be a jolly gardener, I would be a jolly
gardener; with my pot and my pipe, for my swig, and my swipe;
and the devil take the rest, say I!” Bill knew every nose that
was singing this, and every fist that was drumming on the
table. But such were his principles, that instead of pulling up,
he let the reins hang loose, and even said “Kuck” to old
<i>Spanker</i>.</p>

<p>Although we had owned him so long, this horse had never
forgotten his ancient days, when he may have belonged to a
brewer perhaps. For he never could pass any hostelry of a cool
and respectable aspect, with a tree and a trough in front of it,
but that he would offer a genial glance from the corner of one
blinker, and make a short step, and show a readiness to parley.
He did more than this now, for he pulled up short, and tossed
up his nose, and accosted with a whinny a horse of more leisure,
who was standing by the door.</p>

<p>“Wants to wash his mouth out. So do I. But I’ll be
hanged if I’ll go inside all the same.” Reasoning thus, Selsey
Bill got down, for he saw a wisp of hay by the trough just
fitted to dip in the water and cool the muzzle. But before he
could hoist his long legs into the cart, as he positively meant
to do, a buxom short woman had his arm enclasped with two
red hands, and was looking up at him, with words of reproach,
but a smile of good will.</p>

<p>“It ain’t no nonsense, I tell you, Bill,” she exclaimed in
reply to his soft remonstrance; “come in you shall, and have
a word or two inside. I’ve got something particular on my
mind. And you’ll never forgive yourself, if you goes on like
this.”</p>

<p>What could Tompkins do? His wife’s brother’s wife was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Godmother to nearly half his children, and she had a bit of
money of her own, and no children of her own to leave it to.
“Well, only half a minute then,” he said, to ease his conscience;
“and not a drop of beer, you know. Leastways, not
till I’ve been to old Wisk, over yonner.”</p>

<p>“Why, the old chap’s inside! Seems a Providence to me,
because now you be bound to come in and see him. But I
want to talk separate to you, Bill. You have got such a head
you know, such a way up!”</p>

<p>The landlady took Bill to her own room round the corner
of the house, so that no one saw him, while Spanker was linked
to the post and had some hay. And she told him such a story
that his little black eyes, which tried to look at one another
over his great nose, twinkled, and flashed, and were full of
puzzled wrath. Then she brought him a pint of mild ale, for
she knew that his mind worked slowly, and required to be
refreshed.</p>

<p>“Never heered tell of such a job in my born days. Couldn’t
’a believed it, if it wasn’t you, Eliza. You was always truth
itself. But how can you be sartin the young girl as told you is
quite right in her mind?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t be certain, Bill, for she is a stranger about
here. But she looks right enough, and she was genuine flustrated.
And more than that, there’s several things that comes
to back her up like. What shall we do, Bill? That’s the
point.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough, so it is. What does Teddy say to it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know what he is. If he see a murder doing,
I believe he’d shut his eyes and ears, and whip round the
corner. And besides that, he is never no good after two o’clock;
and I only heard of this about an hour ago. So, to tell you the
plain truth, I haven’t said a word about it. And it’s no good to
tell him nothing till to-morrow morning. Not that he takes so
very much, you know. But his constitution is that queer. If
you had not come by, I was just making of my mind up to put
on my shawl, and step off for the police. Though it’s three
miles to go, and then most likely never find them.”</p>

<p>“And if you did, I don’t believe they’d take a bit of notice.
Leastways, not, if they was disposition’d same as ours. Got
never a Justice of the peace round here, some countries they
calls them a Magistrate?”</p>

<p>“Nobody nearer than Colonel Bowles, and Ted was saying
yesterday that he was gone from home. No, Bill, for all I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
see, there’s not a soul to move a finger, unless ’tis you and
me.”</p>

<p>“But what can us do? I can’t see no call for us to meddle
if policemen won’t. Enough to do with my own kids, sister
’Liza, and nobody but me to help ’em. Well, I must be
jogging.”</p>

<p>“No you won’t be jogging, and you’ve got to see Wisk.
Where’s your common sense, Bill? Can’t you see that he’ll
stick a shilling on to everything, if they send down here to fetch
him for you. No man can abide to be disturbed with his glass,
and he expects a lot of money if he gives it up. That’s the
way all those ranters thrive; their beer would cost three halfpence,
and they gets sixpence for not having it, and has it on
the sly in their own beds. Go and see old Wisk, but not a
word of what I told you. Only you must come back to me
when you have done what you want with him. No business of
mine any more than yourn, and perhaps the best way to let
things go by law, and not be called up and lose your time, and
have to pay for it, and think yourself lucky if they don’t fine
you too. That is all one gets for not winking at a thief, Bill.”</p>

<p>The truth of this was too manifest to require any acknowledgment;
and Tompkins went to see Mr. Wisk in the taproom,
and after much discussion drove him to his premises,
there to see and deal about the wicker stuff. But he only got
half a gross of Sallies, which proved a very lucky thing afterwards,
for Wisk had no more, or at any rate said so, not liking
the price perhaps, for they were good substantial stuff, which
also proved a happy thing before very long. Then Selsey Bill
touched <i>Spanker</i> up, for it was getting on for dark; but he did
not like to pass the <i>Crooked Billet</i> without calling, because he
was proud of being a man of his word.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />

<small>THE GIANT OF THE HEATH.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> is, or at least there used to be, along the back of Hounslow
Heath, a lane, which leaves the great Western road on the
right-hand side, and goes off alone. The soil is very poor and
thin, and nothing seems to flourish much except the hardier
forms of fir, and the vagrant manner of mankind. The winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
winds and the summer drought sweep over or cranny into it;
and a very observant man is needed to find much to talk about.</p>

<p>But wherever a man or woman is, and whatever may be the
season, one earnest cry arises in the bosom, and it is for beer.
Those nobler beings who oust their British nature with foreign
luxury, and learn to make belief of joy in the sour grape or the
stringent still, are apt to forget, as perverts do, the solidity of
the ancient creed. If a good or evil genius had stood by Sir
Cumberleigh Hotchpot, or even Downy Bulwrag, and whispered,
“Have a firkin there of treble X, or Indian Pale,” there might
be now no chance for Bill to tell the things he had to tell.</p>

<p>When Tompkins, with his cart half full of Sallies piled like
flower-pots, pulled up again at the wayside inn, he found it
dark and lonely. The four jolly gardeners were gone home, or
at any rate gone somewhere; Teddy, the landlord, was fast
asleep by the kitchen fire, and would so remain till roused by
the music of the frying-pan; they kept no barmaid, and the
man who generally lounged about the stable was gone to have
his lounge out somewhere else.</p>

<p>“Good-night, ’Liza,” Bill shouted up the staircase, on the
chance of the landlady hearing his voice; but instead of any
answer her step was heard, and she turned the corner on him
with her shawl and bonnet on.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t leave it so,” she said; “I don’t know what come
over me. But after you was gone my heart fell all a pitter-pattering.
And such bad ideas come into my head—I never
did! I could no more sleep this blessed night, without knowing
more about that there business, than I could stand on my
head and strike the hours like a clock. I may be a fool for it,
and have to go before the Justices; but ease my mind somehow
I must.”</p>

<p>“’Liza Rowles,” replied Selsey Bill, standing nearly two
feet above her, but looking down with true deference, “if you
feels that sort of thing, who am I to go again it? You are
bound to have summat in your own mind, as was never
put there for nothing, ma’am; and if it comes to that, why, so
has I.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say, Bill,” asked Mrs. Rowles with awe,
not of his height, for she was used to that, but of his thoughts
coming just to her level, “that you has had queer ideas too,
about what the little girl was a-telling me?”</p>

<p>“You have put it, ’Liza, in the very words as I should have
put it in, if the Lord give me the power. But I leaves all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to my wife now. She can fit it up to meanin’, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Bill, there’s no more to be said. Off I goes
with you, and you drives round by Struck-tree Cottage, as we
calls it; not that we means to make tantrups, you know; but
just to see how it looks, and ease our minds.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowles cast a glance at the high step of the cart, for
she was not so tall as she was tender; and Selsey Bill cast a
glance at her, balancing in the fine poise of his mind, whether
or no he should venture to offer, as it were, to lift her. But he
saw that it would not be just to his wife, who might come some
day to hear of it—for you never can tell what those women
will let out,—so he whipped forth his knife, and cut the cord
which bound a dozen Sallies into one spire, and fetching out a
basket, set it down upon the rim; so that Mrs. Rowles (though
of good weight and measure) taking that for her first rung went
up without a groan.</p>

<p>“You take next turn towards Harlington, and go along
quiet as you can, Bill;” these were her orders, when she had
settled down with a clean sack beneath her on the driving-board.
“And now shall I tell you what I believe? It may
be wrong, of course; we all are liable to horrors. You feels
that yourself, Bill, though a man with such a family get’th
more opportunities, so to say?”</p>

<p>“And a wife,” answered Bill; “her comes first to begin
with.”</p>

<p>“In course, her comes first in the regular way. A good
and faithful wife, and the mother of seventeen. But without
such luck as that, I knows what men is; and I say to you, Bill
Tompkins, that they differs very much. I makes the very best
of them, as is the duty of a woman, and leads to their repentance,
when they has it in them. But most of them has not,
without a word against my Teddy. And I say that this Lord
Hopscotch here—if such is his name, being very doubtful—is
up to some badness, having no belief of any one down this way
to right it. Therefore you take that corner, Bill, and go on
slowly till I tell you when to stop. Mind, I don’t say I know
what it is; but I can guess. We have had a many gay doings
down this way, for all it looks so innocent, and perhaps for that
same reason.”</p>

<p>“What can ’em want with more childers, if that way inclined?”
But the quiverful Bill dropped his essay on that
subject; for there is much more bashfulness among poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
people, than among their betters, on such topics of discourse.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a dark, quiet elbow of the road, or
rather of the track across the turf; for they had passed all
stones and hedges now, and the wheels went softly upon the
grass and peat. A clump of Scotch firs, bowed by the west
winds, overhung the way, and made it sombre as the grave.
About a hundred yards before them was a low square building,
on the verge of the heath, and surrounded with bushes and
something that looked like a wooden palisade.</p>

<p>“That’s where it is. That is Struck-tree Cottage; the
lightning come down and scorched the old oak.” Mrs. Rowles
spoke in a whisper, as if herself afraid of it. “You see there’s
a light in the parlour, Bill. That’s where the villains is, I do
believe, and the poor lady locked away upstairs, maybe. Now
you go forrard, and just peep in. They’ll never be capable of
suspecting nothing; and everything will be black to them outside.”</p>

<p>It was quite dark now, without moon or stars. Spanker
and the cart, which was painted brown, could scarcely be descried
even twenty yards away, and the Sallies were of unpeeled osier.
Bill handed the reins to his sister-in-law, and got down in his
usual lanky style. Although he was a very hard-working
fellow, nothing could drive him into quick jerks; for his joints
were loose, and were often heard to creak, when the wind was
in the east, and the air too dry.</p>

<p>“But if them cometh at me?” he asked with proper prudence,
and a sense of his importance to three crowded rooms
at home. “Why, I ain’t got so much as a stick to help me?”</p>

<p>“No fear, little Billy. Guilty conscience makes a coward.
You need not let them see you. And if they do, why, they’ll
take you for the Giant of the Heath—the old highwayman as
was hanged in chains, not a hundred yards from here. My
father seed him often; and when he fell down, he took to
walking through the fuzz.”</p>

<p>“Oh Lor’, no more of that ’Liza! All my teeth be gone
a-chatterin’. Give us a sack at any rate, if I meets he.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowles, who was not very happy herself, handed him
a spare sack from the cart; and Bill Tompkins, with many
glances right and left, and heartily wishing himself at home,
set forth towards the cottage, walking very slowly, and carefully
shunning every stick and stone that was visible on the
brown, inhospitable earth. As he passed beneath the shattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
tree, he looked up with a shudder at the jagged fork, and
naked stubs, and contorted limbs, expecting the dead highwayman
to clank his ghostly chains. Then he stole on with
more courage, for he was tolerably brave, at least as regarded
fellow-beings in the flesh.</p>

<p>When he came to the fence, a low palisade of fir, he just
lifted his long legs over it, without casting about for any gate
or door. As he groped along the fence towards the house, he
discovered a gate which appeared to be locked, and observing
that the palisade was much higher there, he very wisely lifted
this gate from its hinges, and left room for himself to slip
through at the back, if pursued, and obliged to retreat
in a hurry. Then he made his way stealthily through
some low shrubs to the corner of the cottage, and considered
things.</p>

<p>It was quite a small building, with only four windows in
front, and a door with a little porch between them. Two
windows were on the ground floor, and two above; the windows
of the downstair rooms had outer shutters, or rather framed
blinds of lattice-work, such as carpenters call “louvres.”
These were closed and fastened; but from the one on the right
of the porch a strong light came through the interstices of the
blind, and streamed in narrow slices on the misty gloom outside.
The horizontal laths were turned at such an angle, that
a man of common stature could only see the floor between them;
but Selsey Bill was almost a giant, and hearing loud voices in that
lower room, he approached the window stealthily, and standing
on tiptoe, applied one eye to the top of the framework of the
blind, where he found a wide slit between the beading and first
lath. Through this he could see nearly all that was inside, for
the curtains hung back at the end of the pole. Also he could
hear pretty well what was said, for the window-glass was thin,
and the ceiling low.</p>

<p>There were only two men in the room, both lounging in
shabby armchairs near the fire, and smoking, yet not looking
peaceful. Tompkins was surprised at this, because he could
never have his own black pipe, with the cheapest and strongest
tobacco to puff, and his own bit of fire to dry his sodden feet,
without feeling as if he could stand anything from any one,
even to the theft of his very last halfpenny by his youngest
boy Bob, who was bound to know better, with so many rascals
in front of him. And these rich gentlemen (for so they
seemed) were smoking a fine blue curly cloud, such as a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
man can only put his nose to, when the putty is gone from the
glass between him and his true superior.</p>

<p>Bill became deeply curious now. That gentlemen of such
tip-top style, too grand almost for the world to carry, drinking
rare stuff like the sun through church windows, and smoking
(as if it was so much dirt) cigars such as Bill knew by memory—for
he had picked up a pretty fair stump sometimes—that
they should be hob-nob in this little room (no better than his
own Uncle Tompkins had), yet not at all hob by nob soft and
pleasant, and looking fit to fly at one another, for two peas—all
this must mean something as was natural for police, if only
they could be persuaded to do more than flap their white gloves
in view of tricks that were nobby. Mr. Tompkins applied a
dry rasp to his lips with his knuckles, well fitted for that operation,
which had many times saved the mouth from evil issue.
Then he listened and gazed intently; as no man can do, who
has had his powers spoiled by the higher education.</p>

<p>“Then it quite comes to this,” said the gentleman whose
face was in full view to Bill, though by no means a fair view;
“that you mean to throw me over, after all my risk, and take
the fair spoil for yourself. I have known a good many cool
things in my time; but this by long chalks is the coolest.”</p>

<p>“Take it at that same temperature,” answered the larger
and younger man, who was lolling back, with the roof of his
system exposed to Bill, who perceived therein a likeness to
the back of a yellow Skye dog who has not been combed very
lately; “you have let yourself in for it, for the sake of filthy
lucre; and, alas! it proves that I was entirely misinformed.
Make the best of it, old man. You have rushed into a scrape.
There is too much proof, I fear, that it is all your own doing.
The law will be down upon you, and where is your defence?
There is one way, and only one, to hush it up. The girl must
marry one of us, after what has happened. She has not got a
sixpence, and she is wild with rage. Disappoints me there,
after all my mother’s lessons. Don’t think you could tame her,
Pots; but feel sure that I could. Then here I step in, like the
deuce from a machine, and magnanimously offer to make
amends for my mistake. And instead of being grateful, you
set to and slate me! Consider what a lot of that I shall have
from the mother.”</p>

<p>“You can stand anything,” said the other, with a sigh;
“but I am not as tough as I used to be; and a row in the
papers brings the duns in by the dozen. The girl is as sweet a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
woman as ever looked through a bridle. And I had set my
heart upon her, when I thought she would have money. But
I could not marry her like this, and be laughed at ever afterwards,
for eloping with a pauper. Can’t you take her back to-night,
and nobody the wiser? Then perhaps I can have her, in
the proper course of things.”</p>

<p>“Impossible, you thick old Pots. She has not tasted bit or
sup for four and twenty hours; and her face it is a show, as the
old women say. No, it must be reeled straight off this time.
You can hear her moaning now; that old woman is a fool, and
the little girl a rogue, who would betray us, if she could. But
we are all right here; and to-morrow the fair Kitty will accept
me as her deliverer. We shall make short work of it, and you
retire blameless.”</p>

<p>The other man began to growl, but Bill stopped not to hear
him. His righteous soul was wild already, and his mercy flowed
unstrained. Now and then there had come, as from an upper
window, the sound of low sobbing, and the weariness of woe,
when some human creature finds the whole world set against it,
yet cannot get out of it to seek a better. Bill stepped quietly
round the little porch, and stood beneath the window whence
the sound appeared to come.</p>

<p>The window was over the kitchen, as it seemed, and the sill
was about twelve feet from the ground. But the kitchen blind
was down, and the firelight dull within. Tompkins laid his
sack along the kitchen window-sill, and stepping on it softly,
could just reach the stone at the bottom of the bedroom window.
With a little groping he contrived to get one foot upon the
branch of a pear-tree, which was trained against the house, and
lifting his tall frame warily, he got his chin upon the level of
the window-sill above. The whole aperture was barred with
stout wire-netting; but the lower sash had just been lifted to
throw something out, something white like an eggshell, that
flew by as Bill drew back.</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t have it, won’t you?” said a cross and cracky
voice; and Bill saw by the light of a guttering tallow-candle, an
old woman going towards a young one who lay on a low iron
bed with brass knobs at the corners. “Well, you knows your
own business best, and pretty airs you gives yourself. I tell
you there ain’t nothing in it, but new-laid egg and good sherry
wine, and you see me mix it up yourself. A pretty one you’ll
be to go to church to-morrow, wi’out a bit of colour in your
cheeks, or a bit of victuals in you. Cry, cry, cry, all the blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
day long, ’stead of being proud to stand up with a rich gentleman!
My patience with you are pretty well worn out, and a
pretty dance you led me all last night! But I’ve got something
in the kitchen as will force you for to swallow, something come
a purpose this very day from Lunnon, and directions with it
for the fractious folks. Now I try you fair once more, miss,
if miss it is; and after that I try you foul, you see if I desn’t.”</p>

<p>But the lady, who lay with her face to the wall, and a mass
of curly hair shining down her black dress, would not even look
round, or make any reply, but just lifted one elbow, and then
let it fall again.</p>

<p>“Very well! We’ll see. Just you wait ten minutes, while
I has a bit to eat myself; and then we’ll try the little tickler.
Nobody to thank but yourself, you know. If ever there was a
cantankerous, sulky, self-willed young minx, and ungrateful to
boot—”</p>

<p>The wicked old woman, went muttering from the room,
leaving the window still open, and the candle flaring and
smoking on the chest of drawers, but locking the narrow door
behind her with a rusty squeak of key.</p>

<p>“Now or never,” thought Bill, who would have liked,
deeply respectful as he was to the fair sex, to have taken that
old hag by the throat. With one hand he got a good grasp of
the sill, while he passed the other through the wire grating, and
raised the sash a little higher, to attract attention. But the
fair prisoner was too far gone in distress and despair to heed
any light sound, or even a creak and rattle.</p>

<p>“Miss, Miss, if you please, young Miss!” Bill put his mouth,
which would open as wide as almost any cottage window, as far
in as ever it would go (for the wire was much in his way) and
blew his voice in. But whether it was from the “wealth of her
hair”—as all our best writers express it—or the action of the
throat upon the ears (which may have been sobbed into deafness),
there she lay like a log, and as if no Bill Tompkins had
his heart throbbing only for the benefit of hers.</p>

<p>“Rat they women!” thought Bill to himself. “If you
want ’em to hear, can’t make ’em do it. If you wants to keep
a trifle from ’em, cut both your feet off, and walk upon your
fanny-jowls. Here goes, neck or nort!”</p>

<p>He had pulled out a big wall-nail with a heavy shred attached,
and choosing a wide space of the wire-netting, he flung
it so cleverly at the head oppressed with sorrow, that the owner
jumped up, and looked about, and rubbed the eyes thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hush, miss, hush, for the Lord’s sake hush!” whispered
Bill, as if the first effect of feminine revival must be the liberation
of the tongue; “it’s only me, miss,—Bill Tompkins from
Sunbury. Please to come nigher, miss, till I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand. I seem lost altogether. They have
locked me up here, and they may kill me, before I will do a
single thing they want of me. What are you come for? And
what makes you look at me? There is nobody to help me—not
a person in the world.”</p>

<p>“Lor’ bless me, if this don’t beat cock-fightin’!” As she
tottered towards the window, with both hands upon her head,
the light of the candle shone into her dazzled eyes, weak and
weary as they were with floods of tears; and she waved her
fingers over them with a strange turn of the palm (which was
deeply cupped), a turn quite indescribable, a bit of native
gesture which was most attractive, and certain to be known
again, though it might have seemed to pass unnoticed.
“Miss, if I ever see two ladies in my life, you be Miss Kitty,
our Kit’s sweetheart!”</p>

<p>“What is the good of a sweetheart to him? Don’t tell me
anything, I can’t bear it. I was going to his funeral—his
funeral, yesterday; and they put me in a carriage for the purpose;
and they lost their way, so they said, and they brought
me here. And instead of going to his funeral, I am to marry
some one else. But I won’t do it. I’ll never marry any one
but Kit; and Kit is dead, and gone to heaven.”</p>

<p>“The d——d liars! Did they tell you that?” cried Tompkins,
as if that would never be my destination. “Our Kit, miss, is
as alive as you be; though he have had a bad time of it, and be
gone to Ludred now. We expects him home next week, we
does. And proud he would be, Miss, to see you there afore
him. There never were such a chap to carry on about a gal,
leastways beg pardon, Miss, I means a fine young lady.”</p>

<p>He was talking thus, because she could not speak; which he
had the human kindness to perceive. “Is it true?” she was
able to ask at last; and he answered—</p>

<p>“True as Gospel. S’help me Taters, miss, it is!”</p>

<p>Then she knelt for a moment, to thank the Lord. But Bill
said—“No time now, miss. Out of this you comes, this very
minute, and home with me to Sunbury. Can’t get out of
window. Took good care of that. Come out of door, and slip
downstairs.”</p>

<p>“But she has locked me in,” cried Kitty, “and there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
two dreadful men downstairs. I don’t care what they do to me
now, now I know what you have told me. Go away, while you
can. They will kill you.”</p>

<p>“Just you go to that there door, and drive back the catch
with this here knife. It’s nothing but a gallows staple; and a
rap with the butt end will send it back, ten to one it will, miss.
Put your handkercher over the lock, while you does it, and
back it goes, if I know them locks. Have the can’le handy,
to see where to hit. Then down to front door, and away to our
cart. But don’t lose my knife, for the Lord’s sake. A sensible
gal has always got two pockets.”</p>

<p>Kitty, with her strength revived by spirit, took the big knife
with an iron butt, and easily drove back the bolt, for the staple
was an open one. Then Bill descended, without any noise,
while she slipped gently down the stairs, and in the porch he
met her. The front door had been bolted, but she drew back
the bolt, and Bill took her hand, and she stood outside.</p>

<p>“Halloa! What’s up?” cried a voice from inside, for the
catch had closed again with a loud snap.</p>

<p>“Run, miss, run; while I stop these chaps,” shouted Bill,
and she ran like a hare from a dog. For a moment or two Bill
was able to hold the brass knob of the lock against the two
from within; but presently it slipped from his hand, and the
door flew open, and two men prepared to rush out. But
Tompkins threw his sack at full length over the head of the
foremost; and striking wildly down he came on his knees, and
the other fell across him. Bill made off, like a shot, while they
cursed one another; and before they were afoot again, he had
slipped through the opening of the unhinged gate and pulled it
after him. Then using his long legs rather slackly, but to great
effect through the length of their stride, he took the struck tree
for his landmark, and without thought of the ghost, soon had
Kitty at his side, and they made off, hot foot, for the cart and
Mrs. Rowles.</p>

<p>“Here you be, here you be!” shouted that good lady;
“mind the ruts. The villains are after you.”</p>

<p>This was too true. Though they might not have owned that
description of themselves, two hasty men, without even a hat
on, were rushing about, bewildered by the darkness and their
own excitement, and taking the wrong way more often than the
right. They fell among the furze, and got patterns on their
faces, and showed no gratitude to Nature for one of her best
gifts. But presently they spied the white nose of Spanker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
which was hanging down with wonder if he ever should get
home; and then they saw two figures in a hustle by the cart,
and one was being helped in by the long stretch of the other.</p>

<p>“Stop thieves!” cried Sir Cumberleigh, who was dreadfully
out of breath; and therefore perhaps he let the other form go
first to stop them.</p>

<p>Then Bill turned round and faced them, and he said—“You
get away! You ain’t got no right with this young leddy. And
so help me God, I’ll smash you, if you offers for to touch her.”</p>

<p>He advanced with his great fists revolving like a windmill,
that being our accepted view of the “art of self-defence.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Rowles cried, “No, Bill!” while the other stood
amazed at the height of his antagonist and his uncouth look;
“don’t soil your hand with him. Clap this upon his poll.”</p>

<p>Before Downy could guess what was meant, he was basketed.
A big taper Sally, full of sharp stubs inside, was clapped down
upon his yellow head, and fixed there staunchly, by a heavy
rap from Bill’s great hand upon its bottom. Roars of pain and
stifled oaths issued from it faintly, and the wearer fell down
upon the grass and rolled, like a squirrel in his wheel, or a dogfish
in an eel-cruive.</p>

<p>“Little one for t’other!” cried the clever landlady; and in
half a second Hotchpot was in the same condition.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Gen’lemen both,” shouted Bill, as he drove
off. “You goes to trap Miss Kitty, and you gets trapped, by
Miss Sally.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowles laughed so loudly at this piece of wit, that her
husband vowed he heard her plainly at the <i>Crooked Billet</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />

<small>A DREAM.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">Come</span> and see who we have got here,” wrote my uncle, not
quite grammatically; but the relatives are enough to puzzle any
one who has not had Latin antecedents—if on the strength of
good spirits I may venture upon a very ancient joke. I knew
who it was; there could be no suspense or doubt. With those
very brief words of his came a little note, in the hand that always
made my hand shake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Darling Kit</span>,” it said; “I am so sorry to hear of your
long and fearful illness. But thank God you are getting
better now, and will soon be as well as ever, I do hope. I
cannot tell you what has happened, till you come, for it would
only excite and worry you. It really seems as if there was something
always to keep us from one another. But we must try to
get over it, my dear; and if we keep our trust in a Good
Providence, we shall. Your uncle is the kindest of the kind to
me; and I am ever so much better, though I only came last
night. I feel that I could wander all day long in these lovely
gardens, with the blossoms, and the birds, and be as happy and
as free from care as they are. But I am not to stay here, as
your uncle thinks it better that I should have two pretty rooms
at Widow Cutthumb’s, which are to be let very reasonably indeed,
and I mean to write to ask my father for the money. You
must not come back one day sooner, on account of my being
here; mind that, or I shall be very angry with you. This is
not because I do not long to see you, for you know better than
that, dear Kit; but because I want you to get quite well,
which is a great deal more to me than my own health. And so
it always should be, if people love one another. Give my best
regards to your aunt, Miss Parslow, and tell her that I love
dogs quite as much as she does. And I once had a dear little
dog of my own, but he was taken from me. Now, mind what
I say; for I will be obeyed; at any rate until I have to swear
to the contrary, which is never carried out by the ladies nowadays.
My dear dear, I shall be afraid to look at you. They
tell me you are so different from what you were. And I get
long wrinkles up and down my forehead, if I ever allow myself
to think of it; and though I try not to do it, it will come back
again. But never mind; you will be as strong as ever when
you have a good kiss from</p>

<p class="sig">
“Your own Kitty.”
</p></div>

<p>“Well, I call that something like a true love-letter;” my
Aunt Parslow said, when she had contrived almost to compel me
to show it to her, which I did not feel sure that I had any
right to do. “That’s a true woman, though I never saw her.
She thinks of you ten times as much as of herself; and no man
can pretend to say that he repays it; even when he happens to
deserve it; which has never happened to any gentleman I
knew. You write, and you talk, and you go on with fine
words, till people who listen to you believe, that you mean to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
give up your own ways altogether. And perhaps you do believe
it, at the time, for you never know your own minds at all.
But about three days of it—that’s all there is. I know it from
friends of my own; though, thank God, I had sense enough
never to try it myself. And then it is, ‘Mary, could you fill
my pipe? It would be so sweet, dear, if you did it!’ Or—‘Louisa,
I must have left my handkerchief upstairs. Did you
happen to notice where I put it, dear?’ And she is fool enough
to run for it, and kisses him on the bottom step; and her life
is a treadmill afterwards. Your Kitty is quite of that sort,
mind. I can see it in every word she writes.”</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt Parslow, and you would have been the same,
if any gentleman had had the luck to offer you upon his altar.”</p>

<p>“I believe I should,” she answered, with a snap at first;
and then she smiled slowly, and said, “No doubt I should,
Kit. But try to be no worse than you can help with her.”</p>

<p>If anything can rouse a lover’s indignation—and there are
too many things that do so—such a calm assumption of his
levity and ferocity is the first to set it boiling. “What are
you thinking of?” I asked, without even adding, “Aunt
Parslow.”</p>

<p>“I am pleased to see you in that state of mind,” she continued;
when gratitude alone preserved me, without even a
half-glance at her twenty thousand pounds, from the murderous
speech that was on my tongue. “But you are very young,
Kit. You will come to know better, when you have had
enough of this sweet Kitty. Enough very soon becomes too
much. And then what do you do? You neglect them,
and think that you are very good indeed, if you do no worse.”</p>

<p>Miss Parslow was not at all a spiteful woman; even too much
the other way, if that can be. And of such things she could
have no experience, because she had never risked it. But being
deeply hurt, I said—“You know best.”</p>

<p>She turned back into the house, with all her dogs at her
heels; for none of them cared a bit for the air of heaven, in
comparison with their own food and footstools. And I rather
hoped that she would come out, and say—“You have been very
rude to me; get you back to Sunbury.”</p>

<p>Being in a fine large frame of mind—though the frame was
too large for its contents, I trow—what did I do, but pull out
my Kitty’s letter, and begin it all again; just as if every word
of it were not in my heart already? But it adds sometimes to
the satisfaction of the heart, to be assured once more by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
eyes and brain, that they knew what they were doing, when
they brought it the good news.</p>

<p>The valley of the Mole was very lovely, in this flush of the
fair Spring-tide. Bend after bend, bud after bud, tint upon
tint, all as soft to the eye as the sense of them is to the spirit
within; with the twinkle of the sun stealing through them
shyly, as a youth, in the morning of his love, quivers as he
glances at the beauty of his maiden. All these delights double
their enchantment to the weak, as the lights of heaven multiply,
when the eyes are full of tears.</p>

<p><i>Jupiter</i> (who was the greatest light, at least of the earth, to
Miss Parslow) ran up and sniffed at me, and said “Look out!”
as clearly as the dog of a most observant and genial writer has
learned to say it—up to the last advices. And after him came
his mistress, no longer didactic, but deprecative. The beauty
of woman is that they change so rapidly. Who does not love
a Kaleidoscope?</p>

<p>“I have been thinking over your affairs,” she said, that she
might seem consistent; “and I find my first opinion quite
confirmed. The moment I knew what your condition was, I
said—as you must remember, Kit—‘There is only one thing to
do, and the sooner we get it done the better.’ I will not place
myself under any obligation to Mr. Henderson, though I feel
that he has behaved very well, in not coming over to bother
me. I have sent down and ordered the fly with a pole—I
forget what they call it, I daresay you know—and I have
ordered the green room to be got ready. She must not think
at all of her complexion in the glass. It will be as right as ever,
when she gets downstairs.”</p>

<p>“I have no idea what you mean, Aunt Parslow. But you
must not be put out, because I was always slow.”</p>

<p>“And they talk of the masculine mind! Oh dear, any
girl of your age would have known in a second. There is such
a place as Leatherhead. Isn’t there now?”</p>

<p>“Beyond a doubt. And you the first lady in it.”</p>

<p>“Very well. And there is such a place as Sunbury, and a
road between them, though not at all a good one. Well then, at
Leatherhead there is a young man, crotchety, grumpy, whatever
you like to call him, but horribly stubborn, and possessed
with one idea. And at Sunbury there is a young lady to be
found, very little better, I daresay, and possessed with the
same idea, only upside down, as women are supposed to see
everything. They have got it into their stupid heads, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
they cannot live without one another. It would cost more to
take the young man to her, and perhaps he would never come
back again. It is cheaper to fetch the young lady to him;
though it can’t he done under a guinea. And the fly with two
horses will start in half an hour.”</p>

<p>I told her she was the best woman in the world; and she
answered that I was a hypocrite, yet seemed pleased with my
hypocrisy. Then we had a debate whether Kitty would come,
in which I maintained the negative, for the sake of being convinced,
not against my will.</p>

<p>“You are a perfect stupe,” said my aunt, with sound judgment;
“you don’t know what a woman is, half so well as
<i>Jupiter</i>. Not to talk of affection, or any of that stuff, a woman
thinks ten times as much as a man does of the wickedness of
wasting money. If I went myself, she would think I came for
a drive, and her conscience would be easy. If I sent one
horse, she would hesitate a great deal, if she did not want to
come. But when she sees two horses and an empty carriage,
do you think she would let the man get all the money for
nothing? It would take four horses going the other way,
to prevent her jumping in and saying, ‘Well, I suppose I
must.’ I shall write her a very pretty note, of course. You
had better not be well enough to send anything but your
love.”</p>

<p>I was only afraid that Uncle Corny might take it as rather
a slur upon him, to have his new visitor stolen like this.
But Miss Parslow (who was always extremely desirous to have
her own way, when her mind was made up) declared that
she would make that all right with him. And so she did by
reasoning which I did not try to penetrate, and which she put
vaguely in her note to him. For it was something about
clothing, and deficiency of wardrobe, which men cannot
understand, and are impressed with readily, when the duty of
paying for it falls on some one else.</p>

<p>“Not that I intend to pay,” said Miss Parslow, in confidence
to me, though my uncle was led by her letter to a
contrary conclusion; “but my credit is good in Leatherhead.
I shall get a few things of a becoming style and tone for her,
and have the bill made out to Professor Fairthorn. Messrs.
Flounce and Furbelow may have only got one window, but
they get their goods direct from Paris; and I see from their
circular they expect a large consignment of very chaste
articles, and the latest mode, to-morrow. It will be most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
fatiguing at my time of life. But if I like the girl, as I
know I shall, I can scarcely refuse her the benefit of my
judgment.”</p>

<p>“I think I shall go down the hill a little way, and see what
they have got in the window now,” I answered, for the two
horses now had been gone some four hours; “and then I shall
know the old stuff, if they attempt to mix it with the latest
mode. You can scarcely be too sharp in these little places. It
is not that they want to cheat anybody, and they would rather
not do it to a native. But I should just like to see how much
they have got now.”</p>

<p>“Ah, there is a fine view from the pavement there. You
can see right into Middlesex, and even Berkshire, I am told,
when the day is unusually fine. But I never knew it fine
enough to see five miles. You might as well go and play with
the dogs, my dear.”</p>

<p>To play with the dogs was very well in its way, and had
lightened many a listless hour, when the body was slack for its
to and fro of action, and the mind could take no food, except
as a dog bites grass. Then the tricks of the doggies, their
sprightly flashing eyes, and perception of one’s meaning almost
before it knew itself, as well as their good nature and enjoyment
of a joke, and readiness to time their wits by the slower
pulse of mine—take it as I would or might, here was always
something to teach me that one is not every one.</p>

<p>But I could not see the beauty of this lesson now. Selfish
love had got me by the button-hole, and there never is much
humour in the tale he tells. It is all about himself, and the
celestial one who sent him; and he is so much in earnest that
he cannot bear a laugh. Even the crinolines in the little narrow
window of Messrs. Flounce and Co., where they had to hang
alternate, one high and one low, not to poke each other’s ribs,
although they reminded me of what I had seen in church, suggested
it without a single smile to follow; for my mind, in the
reverence of love, was able to people them with the sacred
form inside. And yet at any other time I must have laughed,
recalling as it did the ingenuity of ladies, who contrived in our
narrow pews to reconcile their worship of a Higher Power with
that of their own frocks. And the ladies who now go limp
may be glad—when fashion comes round in its cycle—to
remember how their mothers made the best of it. Each lady
alternate stood on a high hassock, each lady intermediate upon
the church boards; and so their cages underlapped or overlapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
each other; and when it came to kneeling one could
hear them all contract. There were quite as clever women then
in balloons, as those who end in serpents now.</p>

<p>Vainly I looked down the hill, and vainly back at the crinolines.
The only way to get the thing desired is to leave off
hoping for it. When the sun was gone, and the silver mist
was gliding like a slow-worm up the vale, and all the good
people of Leatherhead had lit their pipes and come out to talk,
I went back slowly to Valley-view, with many a futile turn of
head, and ears too ready to be deceived. But the only wheels
I heard were those of the fishmonger’s cart going quite the
wrong way, for I knew that he had been with a middle cut of
salmon to the hospitable gate of Miss Parslow.</p>

<p>“You had better go to sleep. Here is Betty, nearly wild,”
my aunt cried as she pushed me in; “that blessed butcher has only
just sent the lamb, and the boy let it fall in the middle of the
road. I hope to goodness she won’t come for two hours. If
she does, she will want sandwiches; and there is nothing in
the house to make them of. Go and lie down, Kit; don’t you
see you are in the way? What a lucky thing I told the man
to rest the horses for at least two hours at the <i>Flowerpot</i>. When
he gets into the tap, he is pretty sure to make it four. You look
as white as a ghost, poor boy! Bother that love, it spoils everybody’s
dinner! I haven’t got a bit of appetite myself; and
the first bit of salmon for the season, except one! Go in, get
in; lie down there and roll. Why, you couldn’t even tell where
to find the mint!”</p>

<p>This was all the sympathy I got in my distress; and when
she had poked me into the little room, or lobby, with a horsehair
sofa, where to roll meant to roll off, she locked me up, as
if I had been a pot of jam; and all I could hear was the rattle
of the dripping-pan, or the clink of the plates in the warmer.
It was worse than useless to repine; so I turned my back to
everything and went to sleep.</p>

<p>In sleep, as it has been said of old, the fairest and sweetest
gifts of heaven descend upon helpless mortals. Then alone is
a man devoid of harm, and gone back to his innocence, and the
peopling of his mind is not an array of greed and selfishness.
Then only is he far away from malice, and corrupting care, and
small impatience of the wrongs (which only sting, when they
strike himself), and bitter sense of having failed through the
jealousy of others. And only then—if his angel still returns,
though seared and scouted—does he know the taste of simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
joys, and smile the smile of childhood. What wonder, then,
that his Father comes, with returning love to him, while he
sleeps?</p>

<p>Then if the greatest gift of God to man, that he can see and
feel while in this lower world of life, is that which was the
first vouchsafed,—the love of one, who thinks and tries to
make him nobler than herself—though she generally fails in
that—how can it come more gently to him than as it came,
the first time of all, when he has been cast into deep sleep?</p>

<p>It seemed to be no time for words, and even thoughts
found little room. Without a whisper or a thought, my
cheeks were wet with loving tears, and gentle sobs came to
my heart, and faithful hands were locked in mine. A sweeter
dream never came from heaven; and if sleep were always so
endowed, it would be well to sleep for ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />

<small>URGENT MEASURES.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Miss Parslow</span>, although she pretended to be rough, and to
love dogs better than the human race (for which she could
give fifty reasons), was as truly soft of heart as the gentlest woman
that ever shed a tear. She kept her own history to herself;
and it never struck me that she had any. That is to say, as
concerning us men; who are always supposed to be, but are
not always, the side to be blamed, when things go amiss in
the matter of sweethearting. She had passed through some
trouble in her early days, as I found out long afterwards; but
had not been soured thereby, any more than a river has been
poisoned by its tumbles in the hills.</p>

<p>The spell of Kitty’s beauty and true goodness fell upon
her. At first she strove hard to make light of her, and then
pretended still to do so, when the effort was in vain; but in
three days’ time it was all over; and I felt that with all my
claims of kindred, and the proud Parslow extract of tea in my
veins, I was chiefly regarded as Kitty’s sweetheart. It was—“Where
is Kitty? What would Kitty like for dinner? Did
Kitty tell you what she thought of this parasol? Tell Kitty
that I am waiting for her down the garden.” And so on, until I
began to smile, and to fear that I should never have my Kitty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to myself. And the beauty of it was that Miss Parslow
seemed to think that I was not so attentive as I should be to
Miss Fairthorn.</p>

<p>“What did you mean, by carrying on as you did with that
girl, Sally Chalker?” she inquired one day in a very stern
voice, when I had only asked Miss Chalker if she was fond of
roses. “Are you such an oaf as to think that Sally Chalker is
fit to wipe the shoes of Kitty Fairthorn? And if it is her
money that tempts you, remember that her father is a most
determined man. And there used to be such a thing as
honour among young men. What will Mr. Henderson say,
when I tell him, as I shall at the first opportunity, that you
take advantage of being on the spot, to try to cut him out
with his precious Sally? And I believe that he really is
attached to her.”</p>

<p>There is no end of the bubbles that ladies blow, when they
once begin to dabble in love-affairs. They never can let well
alone, and they have such a knack of setting one another’s
hackles up, that when I hear now of any match being off,
where I knew that the young people loved each other, I never
inquire about stern parents, but ask who the sisters and female
cousins are.</p>

<p>Even Kitty, the best and most sensible girl that ever wore
a bonnet, began to think at last that there must be something
in all this rubbish. I observed that she coloured, and glanced
at me, whenever Miss Chalker’s name came up, as it did
pretty often, entirely through my aunt, who would toss it
about, as a dog throws a bone, when he has exhausted all its
grease. And I used to look down, as if I were thinking very
deeply. Perhaps she would love me more, if she grew jealous.</p>

<p>Then she began to sigh, softly at first, and not enough for
me to be sure of it; but by-and-by more deeply, as she found
me too polite to be aware of this exertion of an undoubted
private right. And she used to say—“Oh, I do admire her,
so much! I think she is so lovely. Don’t you quite agree
with me, Kit?” And I used to say—“Most perfect. Can
there be any doubt about it?” And then she would not look
at me, perhaps for half an hour.</p>

<p>I know that this was very wrong of me—as wrong as well
could be. And I used to steal a glance at Kitty, when she
was not watching, and ask myself if any man with two eyes in
his head could turn them twice on Sally Chalker, after such a
view as that. However, I did not say so; for I felt that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
darling should know better, and if she chose to be like that,
why she must, until she came to reason; and that was her
place, more than mine. But I could not bear to hear her
sigh.</p>

<p>Miss Parslow rather enjoyed this business, which was a
great deal worse of her than anything that I did. For she
herself had set it going, with no consideration for my feelings,
and no right whatever. And I think that she ought to have
healed the mischief, which she could have done at any moment;
whereas she pretended not to see it, although she was much
too sharp for that.</p>

<p>However, it could not go on long, and I had made up my
mind to clear it up, when I was saved the trouble. For as I
sat in my favourite place, with the lovely valley before me,
and the sun sinking into a bed of roses far beyond the Surrey
hills, I heard the little pit-a-pat that was dearer than my pulse
to me, and down the winding walk came Kitty, carrying an
ugly yellow book. She had no hat on, and her hair was tied
back, as if it had been troubling her; and as soon as she saw
me she turned away her head, and hastily passed her hand
over her cheeks, as if to be sure that they were dry. Then she
looked at me bravely, though her mouth was twitching, and
said—“Oh, will you do it for me, if you please?”</p>

<p>“Do what?” I asked very reasonably, though I began to
guess what she was thinking of; for the ugly book was a
Railway Guide.</p>

<p>“Miss Parslow told me to ask you. She cannot make it
out any more than I can. It is very stupid, of course; but
she says that she never met a woman who could make out
Bradshaw, and she would strictly avoid her, if she ever did.”</p>

<p>“But what is it I am to make out? We can’t get to
Sunbury, by any line, my darling.” When I called her that,
her dear eyes shone; but she went on, as if she were correcting
them.</p>

<p>“What I want to make out is a good quick train, without
any extra fare to pay, from London to Glasgow; and it must
arrive by daylight, though I suppose it would have to start at
night for that. But I am not at all afraid.”</p>

<p>“What on earth has got into this lovely little head?” I
made offer to take it between my two hands, as I had been
allowed to do, once or twice, when apparently falling back in
health. But it seemed to prefer its own support just now.</p>

<p>“You must be aware, if you will take the trouble to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
for a minute about it, that I cannot remain here in this sort of
way, living upon a perfect stranger, although she is goodness
and kindness itself; and running into debt in a country place
like this, just because I have got no money. The only thing
for me is to find out my father. He may be delighted to
receive me now, and I may even be able to help him there.
Miss Parslow has promised most kindly to lend me quite
money enough to get to Glasgow. I must write to my father
by this evening’s post, and then I shall be able to start to-morrow;
only I must let him know what train I am likely to
arrive by, for his time is always occupied.”</p>

<p>“A very nice programme!” I exclaimed, as she smiled, or
tried to smile, at her own powers of arrangement. “But if you
please, Miss Fairthorn, what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“You must not ask me,” she said, turning away; “there
are so many things for you to do. Soon you will be able to be
at work again. And if you don’t like that, you can marry some
one with plenty of money, and keep racehorses. I dare say it
is a nice life, for those who like it.”</p>

<p>“I cannot make out a word of this,” I answered; “people
with money, and racehorses! And going to Glasgow by the
train all night! Do try to tell me, dear, what it is all
about.”</p>

<p>“It is only natural that I should go to my father, when
nobody wants me. I am not blaming any one. You must not
imagine that. I have only myself to blame, for believing that
I was a great deal more than I was.”</p>

<p>“When nobody wants you! Oh, Kitty, Kitty, I must be
gone off my head again; and that is why you want to run away
from me. Look at me honestly, and say that it is so. I
would rather give you up, dear, and go mad by myself; than
marry you, if that has once got into your mind.”</p>

<p>She looked at me with terror, and deep amazement; then
fell into my arms, and threw her own around me, and put up
her lips as a cure for every evil.</p>

<p>“How can you say such wicked things?” she whispered, as
soon as I allowed her sweet lips room. “You can have no idea
what I am, if you suppose that I should ask whether you were
off your head, or on it, when once I had given all my heart to
you. But you must not have anybody else in your head.”</p>

<p>“As if I ever could!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but yes, you might.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know who it could be then. As if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
were any one in all the world fit to hold a candle to my own
Kitty.”</p>

<p>“There’s a much prettier girl in this very place, if she did
not stick her elbows out so sadly, as she walks, and put her
heels on the ground before her toes. And if she had not got—well,
not quite green eyes.”</p>

<p>“Somebody else has green eyes, I should say, if they were
not as blue as heaven. Sally Chalker? Why, I would not
touch her with a pair of tongs. And if I did, Sam Henderson
would take the poker to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Kit, can you assure me, upon your word of honour,
that there is nothing between you and Miss Chalker?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t. Because there is the whole world between
us, and what is more than ten times the whole world to me, a
certain little Kitty, who has no fault whatever—except that
she is desperately jealous.”</p>

<p>“Jealous indeed! You must never think that. I hope I
have a little too much faith in you,” she said, as she came and
coaxed me with her hand, making me tremble with her love and
loveliness.</p>

<p>But I said, “Confess, or I will never let you go;” and she
looked up and laughed, and whispered,—</p>

<p>“Well then, perhaps—but only ever such a wee bit.”</p>

<p>Miss Chalker’s ears must have tingled after that; for I
called her a vulgar and common-place girl—which was not at
all true—and a showy dressy thing, and I know not what,
until Kitty came warmly to the rescue; for she seemed to like
her very greatly, all of a sudden, and found out that she walked
quite gracefully. Then I took the hateful Bradshaw, and tied
a flat stone in it, and flung it over the tops of the trees into the
Mole. And when we went in, as the dinner-bell rang—for
Miss Parslow kept fashionable hours now—that good lady
looked very knowing, and asked with a smile which was meant
to be facetious, whether I had seen Miss Chalker lately.</p>

<p>“I saw her sticking her elbows out down the street, and
putting her heels to the ground before her toes,” I answered;
and true enough it was, though I had never observed those
little truths before. Miss Parslow stared, and Kitty gave me
such a glance, that I resolved to have honourable amends, or
do worse.</p>

<p>“You won’t have much more chance of running down our
local belles,” said my aunt, as she handed me a letter; “Mr.
Henderson passed in his dog-cart just now, to see the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
lady who does such dreadful things, and he kindly brought this
letter from your uncle to me. He seems in a great hurry; how
unreasonable men are! I think he might have come and paid
his respects to Miss Fairthorn, even if he did not think me
worthy of that honour. Read it aloud. He is a diamond, no
doubt; but I think he should be treated as the Koh-i-noor has
been.”</p>

<p>Knowing Uncle Corny’s style, I read without surprise:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Kit has had quite time enough to get well. I am
tired of being here all by myself, and I want him in the garden,
for at least three weeks before he is married, which I mean him
to be then, if Miss Fairthorn will kindly agree to it. Placed
as she is, she will see the sense of that; for it is the only way
to make her safe. And I wish her to be married here at Sunbury,
in our old church, where I have always had a pew. I
shall send the tax-cart for Kit to-morrow, and he will arrange
with the lady to come before Sunday to Widow Cutthumb’s,
where I will take uncommonly good care that nobody molests
her. On Sunday the banns will be read for the first time, with
Miss Fairthorn’s full permission, and nobody else’s so far as I
care. We shall hope for the honour of your presence, when
the young people are joined together. Thanking you, Madam,
for your kindness to my nephew, and with my best respects,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">“I am faithfully yours,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Cornelius Orchardson</span>.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>“Well, my dear Kitty,” said my aunt, when I had finished;
“he disposes of you as calmly as if you were a bushel of apples,
or a sack of potatoes. I thought it was the lady’s place to fix
the auspicious day.”</p>

<p>“You cannot expect a bachelor to be at home among such
questions;” I came to my love’s rescue, for she knew not what
to say, and was blushing, and looking down, and wondering
what to make of it. “But I must go to-morrow, if he sends
for me. If old <i>Spanker</i> came for nothing, I should never hear
the last of it. My uncle has heard something, which we do not
know of. He is prompt, and to the purpose; but I never knew
him rash.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see;” Miss Parslow’s voice was much subdued, for
she loved a bit of mystery, and saw tokens of it here. “Don’t
let us talk about it now, until we’ve had our dinner. Kit’s last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
bachelor dinner here! We’ll have a bottle of champagne, to
make us laugh a little at this peremptory wedlock. Your uncle
is a curious man; but if it comes to that, all men are very
curious beings.”</p>

<p>“And ladies are so, in the other sense, and the active one
of the word; but we are never known to complain of that.”</p>

<p>“Of course you never have any secrets. Take your everlasting
in to dinner, and I will follow you. All the world will
have to do that by-and-by, if you only keep up to this high mark
of constancy and devotion.”</p>

<p>Kitty smiled at me, and I smiled at Kitty; for we knew
that any lower mark might do for other people.</p>

<p>Lofty and good as she was, my aunt could scarcely be
expected to see things thus. A lady who has never been up a
ladder, is afraid of her skirts, even more than of her head.
Aunt Parslow was not at all strait-laced—for she had given up
caring about her figure now—but she did think that Kitty and
I were almost too much wrapped up in one another; and perhaps
that was why, in her feminine style, she had brought Miss
Chalker, or vainly tried to bring her, in between us.</p>

<p>On the following day, the spring-cart arrived, with Selsey
Bill’s biggest boy sitting up to drive; and away I went, with
nothing truly settled, but everything left elastic; as happens
nearly always, when the women have their way. I promised
to bring Uncle Corny to reason (as the ladies viewed that substance),
and to come back the next day but one, if wet
bandages enabled the old horse to do it again. He was wiry
enough, but his wire was stiff, and some of the connections
rickety.</p>

<p>“Kit, you are a fool,” Mr. Orchardson said, as soon as he
had done the outside talk; “do you mean to have that girl, or
not?”</p>

<p>I assured him that I hoped quite as warmly and wholly to
marry my beautiful darling, as I did to be alive for the purpose
of doing it, now that the Lord had restored my health.</p>

<p>“Then look alive,” he answered, “or you will never do it.
She is not safe even where she is. I am not going to tell you
what I know, because you would think me fanciful! only I say
that if it was my case, I would not lose a day that is not
demanded by manners and decency. You have her father’s
consent, and hers. You are surrounded by wily foes. I have
explained everything to Mr. Golightly! he is a sensible man,
and he does not care twopence for Miss Coldpepper, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
never gives a sixpence she can help towards the church.
Widow Cutthumb will take fourteen shillings a week including
coals and candles. Two weeks done properly will make three
Sundays, and you will be both in the parish. I have got an
old door, which I mean to put up, to keep people from landing
in her garden, and I defy them to get into the house from the
street. I believe they don’t know where your Kitty is at
present; but they will find out; and what can that old maid,
with all her lap-dogs, do to protect her? If you mean your
Kitty to be ever Mrs. Kit, you must look sharp, and no
mistake.”</p>

<p>I was much surprised at his urgency, but could get no more
reasons out of him. Being equally urged by love, and strong
distrust of coming dangers, I did not lose a single day, but
wrote to Miss Parslow by the very next post, because she
required, and indeed deserved, to have a voice in all we did.
Then I took the young horse on the following day, for old
Spanker found himself a little stiff, and brought back my darling
to her beloved Sunbury, where she had made up her mind to
dwell. Widow Cutthumb received her with curtseys and
smiles, and a very strong sense of her own importance. For the
whole village now was on tiptoe about us, and everybody
seemed to take our side.</p>

<p>But if I stopped to tell a thousandth part of what was said,
I should never get married, which is the main point.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that my Kitty all this time had
neglected her dear father. She had written to him several
times from Leatherhead, enclosing a note or two from Miss
Parslow, as well as a few little bills for soft goods. And he
had replied in the most affectionate manner, and enclosed some
cash. This encouraged her now to write for more; and he
behaved most handsomely, considering how the other party had
been making boot upon the products of his brain. But he was
a true philosopher, and money to him was not the motive
power of life, nor even the shaft, but only the lubricator. He
promised to be with us, if he could; and his wife being still
away in North Wales, there seemed to be no sound reason why
he should fear to come to London. Indeed it seemed natural
that he should come, before leaving England upon his long
cruise, for the <i>Archytas</i>—as the ship was called—had now been
completed in every detail, and was trying her engines at
Greenock. And so we hoped to see him upon the blissful day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />

<small>TWO TO ONE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">Never</span> wur any luck in a wadding, as wur put off from
app’inted day. For why? Why, because it be flying in the
vace of the Lard, as hath app’inted ’un.”</p>

<p>Knowing that Tabby was very often right in her prophecies,
and could prove them right—even when they were wrong—as
most prophets can, I begged her not to say a word about that to
my darling; because she was a little superstitious, although
sprung from the very highest form of science. But science very
seldom keeps its dates; and to make them tally, we had postponed
our day from Tuesday even till Thursday. For Captain
Fairthorn had written again, to say that he could not be with
us on the Tuesday, but was almost sure that he could manage it,
if we would only leave it till two days later. My uncle had
frowned and said—“Not a single hour. If his wheels and his
wires are more to him than his only child, let him stop with
them. But you must leave it to Kitty. Such a question is for
her.”</p>

<p>Vexed as I was, I could not deny this. And she pleaded so
well, though with reason on her side, that we vented our anger
on the absent man, and only our affection and good will on
her.</p>

<p>But the one who made the greatest grievance of it was my
aunt, Miss Parslow. She had hurried her dressmaker to the
verge of mutiny, and made her sit up (either in person, or by
deputy) two whole nights, and she felt that she would have to
pay deeply for this, and now here it was all needless! “I have
the greatest mind not to come at all,” she wrote; “and if it
were for anything but pure compassion, you may be quite sure
that I would wash my hands of you. Men manage everything
in this world, even the things that they understand least; and
you will see what comes of it. If I come on Thursday, I shall
be quite unprepared; though I should have been in perfect
readiness on Tuesday.”</p>

<p>This was a hard saying; but we agreed that she knew what
she meant, and could explain it to her liking. And seeing that
the ladies were now so full of reason, I thought that I would
have another try at Miss Coldpepper.</p>

<p>I had ventured to call upon that lady once, while the preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
were in full swing; but she had said that she was not
at home, and of course she must know best, though I had seen
her walking in her great Camelia-house. My Uncle Cornelius
had been of opinion that, even if she would not honour our
church with her presence, she could scarcely escape from the
duty of sending her former visitor and favourite something very
handsome as a wedding present. A silver tea-service was the
least thing he could think of, but unluckily the last thing that
occurred to her as needful. She had made it a grievance, as
she wanted one, that Miss Fairthorn should have dared to go to
Widow Cutthumb’s, when everybody in the village knew how
shockingly the widow had behaved to Mrs. Marker.</p>

<p>But all this appeared to me to be very small talk now; for I
was in a generous and large condition, such as is only too apt
to credit all fellow-creatures with the like expansion. It should
never be said of me, that any petty pride had prevented me
from holding out the olive-branch—whether to be gilded, or
even to be peeled—at a time when I was hoping to be crowned
with myrtle. Scorning all considerations of a silver teapot, I
went to Coldpepper Manor, and rang gently.</p>

<p>“Missus will see you this time,” said my friend Charles,
who had tasted our strawberries many a time, when he durst
not steal any more at home; “she is all agog about you, sir,
though she shams to know nothing. Happiness to you and
dear Miss Kitty, sir!”</p>

<p>The least I could do was to give him half a crown, for he
had always appeared to me to be a worthy fellow. He slipped
it into his hornet-coloured waistcoat, and bawled out, “Mr.
Christopher Orchardson,” as if I had come in a coach and
four.</p>

<p>“I am pleased to see you, Mr. Orchardson,” said the lady
of the Hall, as I made a low bow; “take a chair, and tell me
what you are doing. I never hear anything that happens in
the village.”</p>

<p>I am not at all certain what reply I made, being fluttered
by the force of habit in her stately presence. But she was
better pleased by this, than she would have been by any
assumption of ease and self-command.</p>

<p>“Although I hear so little, a report has reached me,” she
went on with a smile which was not at all disdainful, “that
you are about to marry Kitty Fairthorn. If so, you are a
wonderfully fortunate young man.”</p>

<p>“It would add very greatly to our happiness, madam,” I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
ventured to say, though with some misgivings, “if you would
be kind enough to give us your good wishes. Miss Fairthorn
has not been to call upon you, because—because she was not
sure that you would wish it. And she is acting entirely without
the consent of her step-mother, who is your sister. I hope
you will not think the worse of her for that. The lady has
never been very kind to her.”</p>

<p>“Kitty was quite right in not coming here; it would have
placed me in an unpleasant position. I have not seen much of
my sister for years. But I cannot enter into such matters.
And you have done right in coming to me thus. Certainly
you both have my good wishes. And though Kitty might have
looked for a much higher marriage—I may say that without
any disrespect to you—I believe that she will be happier in a
very simple life. You will understand that I cannot be present—under
the peculiar circumstances. Neither will you expect
me to receive Kitty here, when she is Mrs. Orchardson; she is
no relative of mine, and she has chosen her own path. But I
like her none the less, and you may tell her that. She has
plenty of proper pride, and would resent my patronage. I was
told that the wedding was to be to-day. Why have you put it
off? You are unwise.”</p>

<p>She looked as if she knew something which would alarm
me, if declared; but I did not presume to ask about it, and
simply told her the cause of the delay.</p>

<p>“You may expect him; but you will not see him,” she
answered, as if she knew more than we did; “don’t put it off
another day, if you wish it to be at all. But it is no affair of
mine. Good morning to you.”</p>

<p>I returned in an anxious state of mind, for she had clearly
dismissed me, that I might ask no questions. And instead of
going straight to my uncle’s house, I hurried to that of the
widow, to make sure that my darling was safe, and all due care
observed. After what had been already done to Kitty, how
could I tell that there was no plot yet in store? My bodily
strength was restored by this time, and I felt myself a match
for almost any man; and surely intense and incessant devotion
must vanquish unholy pursuit and vile designs. All we knew
of our enemies at present was that they had retired from the
scene of their defeat, and locked up the cottage where they had
felt so sure of victory. But my Uncle Cornelius had good
reason for believing that his premises were watched; and a
couple of his men had been tempted to drink by some mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
stranger, who showed the greatest interest in our ways, and
works, and manners. And the worst of it was that the river
(being almost at our doors, and not frequented then as it is
now) afforded such a space for roguish travel, that there ought
to be a paling put up against it, with tenter-hooks, and wire-netting
on the top, if any man desired to keep his garden to
himself. For the people who come up, as they get away from
London, seem to claim the country more and more, and to
think that it was made for nothing else except to be a change
for them; and they reason that as a river must have banks,
those banks are a part of it, and the whole belongs to
them.</p>

<p>My beloved (who was both my banks, and the channel of
all my life as well) had not been left alone all this time, with
only Widow Cutthumb to amuse her. Otherwise she would
have had a sorry time; for that widow had but two subjects of
discourse—the merits of her late husband, and the scarcity of
all vegetables. But a very sharp young lady, Miss Gertrude
Triggs, about three years older than my Kitty, being in need of
country air after an attack of nettle-rash, had kindly consented
to come and occupy the best room at Widow Cutthumb’s. At
first I was uneasy, for if Kitty were to catch that complaint,
after all her other troubles, was she likely to look well upon the
bridal day? But Dr. Sippets said that he would warrant no
infection; and so Miss Triggs came and occupied. And
certainly she helped to set off the complexion, upon which it
was impossible to imagine any rash. At first, I was not fond of
Miss Triggs, for she had too much sting in her words and ways;
and I made no allowance for what she had been through. And
to my mind women should never try to sting, being apt to get
the worst of it (as even do the bees), and intended more by
nature to do the honey-making. But my poor ideas have
always been old-fashioned; and I am sorry (for the sake of
others) that it should be so.</p>

<p>But when I came to understand Gerty Triggs, and to value
her real friendship for my dear one, I acknowledged (as a man
should do) that I had been a gaby. Not only had she protected
Kitty at school, and even lent her under-clothing when she got
no supplies from her step-mother, but she had actually made an
inroad into Bulwrag Castle, to try a round with the great lady
herself, on behalf of the innocent captive. She was rapidly
discomfited, of course; she had resolved to show the truth, but
she was quickly shown the door; and though she maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that she had triumphed, it may have been in logic, but it was
not so in fact; and the result to herself had been this nasty
nettle-rash. However, as she got over that, and put the air of
our garden upon her cheeks, I began to esteem her, and to find
her rather pretty.</p>

<p>It was settled by the laws of nature that she should be
bridesmaid; and Uncle Corny found another not connected
much with trade, yet able to provide her own outfit. My uncle
said, though not to Kitty—for he was quite a gentleman to her
throughout—that he could not discover any call on him to fit
everybody up with gew-gaws. It was her father’s place, if he
wanted things to be done in proper style, to come and see to
them himself, or at any rate to send directions, and the money
to have them carried out. Instead of that, he had left everything
to us, kept us in trouble about the day, and perhaps driven
off Miss Parslow and her twenty thousand pounds. It was plain
that he thought it a higher duty to fit out his ship than his only
child. Considering all this, Uncle Corny was only surprised at
his own generosity; but when I joined him in that surprise, he
cut me very short, and asked what I knew about him. It was
natural enough that he should be cross; and I told him so,
which only made him worse.</p>

<p>Nevertheless when the true day came, which I always recall
with gratitude and wonder at a grace so far beyond my merits,
everybody behaved as if there were nothing but peace and good
will in the world. We received a telegram quite early that the
ship was ordered to sail that day, and the Captain could only
send his blessing. Kitty shed some tears, but all the rest of us
were pleased, because it fulfilled our predictions. And my uncle
was proud to give the bride away, and at the same time to keep
her, as he neatly said.</p>

<p>Miss Parslow came over in style, with a mass of white
flowers piled high on the seat before her, and wearing her silver
gray silk dress, which set her off to great advantage. And she
presented the bride with a silver basket, fit either for flowers or
fruit, and containing a very neat cheque for a hundred guineas.
Sam Henderson acted as my best man, and did everything better
than I did, for I scarcely knew my right hand from my left.
Mrs. Wilcox was present, and so was Mrs. Rowles, without
whom we should never have been there, and Selsey Bill of
course, and every man who possessed a top hat in the parish.
And to our amazement, Miss Coldpepper was sitting in her
curtained pew, although she had said that she would not come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
And after the service she kissed my Kitty, and said that she
would give her something by-and-by.</p>

<p>What my darling wore I have not the least idea, or at least
I had not on that day, though I came to know too well afterwards.
But all the men said, and nearly all the women too,
that she was the fairest, and sweetest, and most lovely of all the
brides ever seen in Sunbury, which was no little thing to say;
for our village is celebrated in that way. And she behaved
with such grace and goodness, that it seemed as if those
blessings must be multiplied upon her.</p>

<p>Several women cried to think that she should look so
Christian after all the treatment that she had received—for
Mrs. Rowles declared that she had been in a wire cage—and if
I were to try to straighten half the crooked tales they told, I
never should find any time for a separate word with Kitty.</p>

<p>Only I remember that when she came and kissed me in her
simple, and loving, and bewitching way, I saw the gleam of
tears in her deep blue eyes; and when I asked (without
words) what it was, she answered,—</p>

<p>“I should have liked to have one kiss from father.”</p>

<p>This proof of her tenderness increased my adoration; for
an affectionate daughter must become a loving wife. Then I
took away my treasure to be mine alone; and Kit and Kitty,
for the time, are one.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.<br />

<small>UNDER THE GARDEN WALL.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Not</span> much time could we have together in the land of Goshen,
where the boils and blains of the ungodly world are not yet
sprinkled in the radiant air. Uncle Corny gave us for our
honeymoon one week—which has often proved much longer
than the silver cord would stretch—but we, intending all our
lives to be of sparkling sweetness, cared very little where we
spent the hours, if only with each other. And perhaps we
scarcely deserved to be in a place so calmly beautiful, not so
far away as to take a cliff of money to get there, and yet having
fine brave crags of its own. Perhaps it may be found in ancient
charts as Baycliff, although it is such a quiet, homely
place, without any railway to advertise it, and I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
some maps which were too good to give the name. But they
could not annihilate it by such petty silence; and a pleasant
seaside village is like a pleasing woman; the less it is talked
about the more it keeps its charms.</p>

<p>For my part, I could not see the need of going back in
such hot haste to Sunbury, dearly as I loved that desirable
village. For here were many things that we could never have
there, the level space and leisure of the many-coloured sea,
the majesty of cliffs white-browed with centuries of tempest,
the gliding of white sails across the gleaming ruffle of the cove,
and the crisp, elastic sands that kept the fairy trace of Kitty’s
feet close to my great clumsy prints.</p>

<p>“Let us steal another week,” I said; “it is but a fleeting
holiday, and we shall never know such a time again.”</p>

<p>But my beloved, growing dearer every day, if that could be,
gave good advice, against her own delight, that we should not
begin our married life with selfishness. We had been so
kindly treated that we must not slur our gratitude, and forget
our duties in our joys.</p>

<p>“And I want to see our little home,” she said, to make the
best of it; “the house that is to be all our own; where I shall
keep you in order, Kit, and make you as happy as the day is
long.”</p>

<p>So with many a backward glance, we left that bower of
bliss, and returned to the world of work and action. And
when we found what had been done, to welcome and to please
us, we could not help confessing that our virtue was well
rewarded. For Honeysuckle Cottage looked as bright and
fresh as sunrise, and the first half of May is not the time to
find much fault with nature. The earth was damp and clammy
yet, in places where the wind and sun could not get fairly into
it; and the spring was late and shivered still among the gaps
it had to stop. For one might look through a big tree yet, and
see a lamp in the road beyond it; and many of those that were
being scarfed wore spangles rather than patins. And people,
who pay little heed, might stop in doubt—if they stopped at
all—and wonder if what they saw coming might prove in the
end to be a blossom or a leaf.</p>

<p>In our little house I had the bud, the blossom, and the
fruit combined. The bud of youth scarce come to prime, the
blossom of fair womanhood, and the fruit of sweet and golden
peace, not sleepy, but sprightly flavoured. It was a fair view
from the window, but inside ten times as fair, without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
chance of adverse weather nipping hope and bright content.</p>

<p>An ancient writer (whom I had just been scholar enough
to understand, when he is easy, in his native tongue) assures
us that this perfect state is never long allowed by Heaven.
According to him, and others whom he considers wiser than
himself, all the powers that govern man are stung with envy
when they see him happier than he ought to be. Generally
they take good care to have no occasion for this grudge; but
when, by any slip of theirs, a mortal has attained such pitch of
comfort and prosperity, there is no peace in Olympus, till this
robber of delight is crushed. And the more he has flourished
and rejoiced, the deeper shall his misery be.</p>

<p>Having only thirty shillings a week, without counting our
presents which had been put by, and paying five and sixpence
out of that for the rent and rates of our small Paradise, we
scarcely can have affronted Heaven by any gorgeous insolence.
And without daring to impugn the wisdom of true philosophers,
I venture still to hold by that which we find in larger and
nobler Writ, that when the Heavenly Power stoops to cut off
our brief happiness, it is to make it more abiding, where there
is no brevity.</p>

<p>But we did not think of such things then; and who would
be sad enough to say that we were bound to do so? Care
would come quite soon enough, we did not care to beckon him.
He must have been a doleful wight, and born with black crape
round his eyes, who could have looked at my merry Kitty,
without catching her bright smile. In the morning, when I
went to work, I carried it with me like a charm, and whenever
I came back at night, it put my memory to the blush.</p>

<p>For we had settled with one accord, that until I had overtaken
the large arrears of work which had lapsed behind
through my long illness and absence, there should be no time
lost by any return for early dinner. And this was better for
my wife too, inasmuch as she had only Polly Tompkins to
assist her, the eldest daughter of Selsey Bill, a very clean and
tidy girl, but of small experience in cookery. I was busy at a
long peach-wall, not the red-brick one, but further down, and
the trees being large and sadly out of order, patient as well as
skilful hands were required urgently. There was a very fine
crop yet unthinned, feeble wood to be removed, robber shoots
to be docked or tamed, green-fly to be dipped or dusted, and all
the other crying needs of neglected trees to be made good. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Kitty used to appear exactly as the old church clock struck
one, with a basket of bread and meat, a pint of ale, and a pipe
filled by her own fair hands, which she used to light for me,
and then trip home, singing merrily among the trees, to see to
the business of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Dare anybody tell me that a wife like this would leave her
dear husband of her own accord, without a word, without a
letter, leave him to wonder, and mourn, and rage, and despair
of his own life and hers? Yet this is what all the world
believed, and impressed upon me, till my spirit failed.</p>

<p>“Now this is all very fine,” exclaimed my uncle, as he came
round the corner of the wall one day, and caught me in the
very act of hugging Kitty, as she was preparing to light my
pipe. She was looking up and laughing, and pretending to
pull my hair, when the deepening of her blush showed that an
enemy was nigh. “This is all very fine; but how long will it
last? How many quarrels have you had already? I suppose
you are making up one of them now.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Corny, you are a disgrace,” cried Kitty, “a disgrace
to the name of humanity. Mayn’t I even whisper in my husband’s
ear, without being accused of quarrelling? We have
never had a single word. Have we, Kit?”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you will now. Here’s a telegram for you.
I was going to send Kit home with it. But as you are so
uncommonly close together, why, it saves the trouble. Hope
some of your enemies are dead, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Hush! Don’t be so wicked,” she said, as she handed it
to me, and I opened it with my pruning-knife, and held it for
her to read first. But this required our united efforts, for it
was badly written, as so often happens, and some of the words
were run together. At last we made it out as follows:—</p>

<p>“Spoke <i>All Kites</i> off Scilly May 7th. Captain Fairshort
desires love and best wishes to his daughter. Will be away
two years perhaps. From Jenkins, s.s. <i>Hibernia</i>, Falmouth.”</p>

<p>“<i>All Kites!</i>” said my uncle, who had read some of the
Georgics, as rendered by Dryden with lofty looseness, but
never a line of Horace; “what a name for a ship, if it is a
ship! Kitty, my dear, is that the proper word?”</p>

<p>“No, Uncle Corny, it should be <i>Archytas</i>. I am not sure
who he was, but rather think that he must have been a king of
Sparta.”</p>

<p>“I know who he was,” I said, to show how much I had
learned at Hampton, though I never was much of a hand at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Horace, and had only found this out in the dictionary; “a
great man of science, who measured the seas, and the sand, and
all that, but could not get to heaven, because nobody would
throw a pinch of dust upon his body. And he lay upon the
shore, imploring somebody to do it.”</p>

<p>“If he could call out, he could have done it for himself,”
replied my uncle, who was not poetical. “Serve him right, at
any rate, for having such a name. But I hope that your father
won’t do that, my dear.”</p>

<p>“I think it was very kind of him, when he could not help
going, and was far away at sea, to get this kind captain of a ship
they met, if we understand it properly, to send me this farewell
message from the deep. And it makes my mind ever so much
more comfortable, because I shall have another message by-and-by,
I dare say. If he meets one ship he must meet others:
and I shall always have a good idea where he is, and have my
mind relieved, when there has been a stormy night. Thank
you, Uncle Corny, you have brought me pleasant news. Kit,
it is high time for you to go on with your wall.”</p>

<p>In this sort of way, by making the best of everything, and
thanking everybody, even if they did not mean to do her any
good, she established in a week a sweet dominion, not over us,
but within us. My uncle, though he liked to have his little
cut at her—for old men treat young ladies as chicks to be carved—got
into the habit of coming up every night of his life to
have his pipe at Honeysuckle Cottage. It may seem very ungrateful
of me, and I now feel ashamed when I think of it, but
after being hard at work all day, and having a bit of cold duck
under the wall, I thought that I might have been allowed when
I came home to tell my dear wife all my thoughts about her,
and how many times I had hammered my thumb-nail through
that. But there Uncle Corny sat, carrying on, as if I had cut
off my tongue with my pruning-knife!</p>

<p>Kitty used to laugh, and ask me who was jealous now.
But I answered, with good reason, that the case was widely
different. Miss Sally Chalker never crossed her legs, and sat
with a long pipe blowing over a supper-table, neither did she
go on talking, as if I were nobody; but rather put me foremost,
even when Kitty herself was present, and asked what my opinion
was, before she gave her own almost.</p>

<p>However, I made the best of my uncle’s conduct at our
cottage; for it was not only my duty, but my important
interest to do so. What was to become of us if Uncle Corny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
(who might be called a huffy man, and stuck to a huff, whenever
he contracted it) should take it into his head that I was
not what he used to take me for? I know that he was full of
truth and justice, according to his own view of them; but if
anything went against his liking, so did truth and justice. So
I had to sink my opinions often, even when they agreed with
his, for he never liked to have them put into any other language
than his own. Kitty was clever enough to see this, and she
always praised me afterwards; but it went against one’s sense
of right, that she might say exactly what I had said, and from
her lips it became true wisdom, when it had been simple silliness
from mine. But Kitty smiled at him, and laughed at me,
and went into his heart more deeply every time she filled his
pipe.</p>

<p>Then a new anxiety arose, and Uncle Corny had more
than he could do to lay down the law for his own affairs. The
wind went into the east, with a hard blue sky, and not a cloud
in it. We had passed the date of the “icy Saints,” as they
are called in Germany, when a cold wave of air is said to flow
over hundreds of leagues of smiling land, and smite it all into
one dark frown. If I can remember, without an almanac, that
date is about the seventh of May; but I have never found it
quite so punctual here; and according to my observation, the
bloom of England hovers in nightly peril, from the middle of
April to the very end of May. It is one of the many sad things
we meet, but can only fold our hands and watch, that for nearly
six weeks of the year, and in early seasons even more, through
all our level southern lands, the fruit-crop trembles on the
hazard of a single night’s caprice. The bright sun and the
lovely day delude the folk who know no better; these are the
very things that lead to the starry night, and the quiet cold,
and the white sheet over the grass at five a.m., and the black
death following. The barren grower walks between his rows of
wounded blossom; there is little harm to be seen at first, some
of the petals are as fair as ever, others are just tipped with
brown; and perhaps his wife runs up and says—“Oh, you
need not be in a fright, my dear; why, they all look as well as
ever.”</p>

<p>But he, with deeper wisdom, and the smile of prophetic
silence, pulls out his budding-knife, and nips the fairest truss
he can find of bloom. Then he lays it in his palm, and haply
with keen edge bisects the pips. A keener edge has been there
before him; a little black line passes up from the baby stalk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the pistil. The ovary is dead and shrunken, though the anthers
still may be tipped with pink. Never shall a fruit grow there,
to swell and stripe itself with sun, to flood a plate with sprightly
juice, and in its dissolution hear some sweet voice say—“Oh,
I never did taste such a lovely pear!”</p>

<p>All these horrors threatened now, in spite of the lateness of
the spring. In a forward spring, they more than threaten,
they come down and smash everything. But being now so
late, we began to have some confidence, misplaced as it might
be, in the meaning of the sky. And now for the wind to go
back to the east (after living there so many months, that it
ought to be downright sick of it), and the sun to go down red
and clear, like a well-grown turnip-radish, and the stars to
come out small and sharp like a lot of glaziers’ diamonds, and
the mercury in the thermometer to drop, as if the bulb had been
tapped about six o’clock, and scarcely a breath of wind to stir
the fans of radiation—it was more than enough to make any
grower fetch a groan at the day when himself was
grown.</p>

<p>But my uncle was not of the groaning order, neither did he
even hang himself; as one of our very best neighbours did,
when he saw his thermometer at twenty-two degrees, one
radiant May morning; but his wife, who could enter into his
feelings, cut him down with a gooseberry-knife, and enabled
him to grow out of it. My uncle used to read the gardening
papers; which always bloom with fine advice; and one of them
had lately been telling largely how, in Continental vineyards,
these cold freaks of heaven are met by the sacrificial smoke
of earth. To wit, a hundred pyres are raised of the rakings and
refuse of the long vine-alleys, and ready for kindling on the
frosty verge. Then a wisp of lighted straw is applied to each,
when the sparkling shafts of frost impend, and a genial smoke
is wafted through, and Sagittarius has his eyes obscured. I
told my uncle that this was rubbish, at least as regarded our
level lands; though it might be of service upon a hillside.
That if there were wind enough to spread the smoke, there
must also be enough to prevent the hoar-frost, which alone need
be feared at this season. But he told me to stick to what I
understood; for these scientific things were beyond me, and my
business was to tend the fires.</p>

<p>But in spite of all this brave talk, he was afraid of casting
a slur upon his old experience by a new experiment. For the
British workman disdains new ideas, and there was not a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
upon our place but would say that the governor was turned
cranky, if he got any inkling of this strange scheme.</p>

<p>“I shall have all the stuff put there,” said Uncle Corny,
“ready for lighting, when they are gone. Those thick-heads
will never suspect that I want to do anything more than burn
up the weeds, as we generally do at this time of the year.
Then as soon as we see the danger coming, you and I will go
out and attend to it, my boy. Not that I place any great faith
in it, although it seems very sensible, to those who understand
the principles, which young fellows cannot be supposed to do.
At any rate, I mean to try it. It can do no harm, if it does no
good. You need not say another word; but do just what I
tell you. I wasn’t born yesterday, as you ought to know by
this time.”</p>

<p>I knew that well; for it takes many years to root a man
into such obstinacy. As a rule, I was much more inclined
to give fair trial to anything new than he was, and much
more ready to risk money on it. But this would cost nothing,
except a little work, and that I could not grudge him. So
I told my dear wife not to be uneasy, if I did not come
home till after dark some night, for our doings depended of
course upon the weather; and the quarter of young pear-trees,
which my uncle meant to smoke, was the furthest part
almost of all the premises from Honeysuckle Cottage. Kitty
smiled, and said she would come down and see it, and roast
a potato or two for our supper, and we would go home together,
when the work was done, and make Uncle Corny
come with us. Alas, how differently it all turned out!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />

<small>FROST IN MAY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was on Wednesday, the fifteenth of May, as fine a day as
ever shone from heaven, that my Uncle Corny came up to our
cottage, soon after we had finished breakfast. I had done my
two hours of early work, according to agreement, and was ready
to start for the long day now, and do my best among the
trees, until it should be “blind-man’s holiday.” It had been
arranged between my wife and me that I was not to expect her
with my noonday meal, but should carry it with me, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
she was to be busy at home with a grand turn-out. We had
now been home from our bridal trip, for ten days of bliss and
perfect peace, and Kitty had declared that it was high time to
give our little rooms a thorough cleaning. So far as I could
see, they might go another month as they were, and be all the
better for it; but in all such matters the wife is supreme, and
the wise man never attempts to gainsay, but only hopes to find
some of his property surviving. I had always been most particular
about scraping my shoes and then rubbing them on the mat,
not as some men do, like a dog’s feet scratching, but attending
to the welting, and the heels, and toes, until they were as clean
as a dinner plate. This trifle I mention, because some women
said that we had a misunderstanding about the mud I brought in.</p>

<p>Now as Kitty had declared that there must be a turn-out
for she was wonderfully fond already of our little home, I had
never even asked whether it would not do next week—as many
men do, and get a sharp reply—but feeling quite certain that
she must know best, made up my mind accordingly. Only I
suggested that she ought to have Mrs. Tompkins in to help her,
instead of her daughter, our Polly, who was as nice a girl as
could be, but scarcely knew the door-knocker from the boiler-tap.
I suspect (perhaps basely) that my darling was afraid
that she would have to play second fiddle, if Mrs. Tompkins
came; but be that as it may, she would not have her; and
simply asked, “How much did I give you back on Monday,
dear?” The sum had been ninepence halfpenny, a handsome
residue of the fifteen shillings, which under her own scheme of
finance, she had drawn from our revenue for the week’s consumption.
I had said that she ought to take a pound at least,
but she stuck to her figure, and would have shown a balance
even more considerable, if Uncle Corny had not dropped in with
such geniality for supper. “Your frugality is beyond belief,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Halloa!” cried Uncle Corny, as he came in after breakfast,
without even scraping his boots, and carrying a suckering iron,
which he poked into a rose—or at least we had determined that
it must be a rose—of our new and artistic paper—“signs of it
already! I expected it last week. Going to have a turn-out,
and knock everything to pieces.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t carry long iron hoes,” answered Kitty,
pointing to the rose which he had suckered off the wall; and
he laughed and shook hands, and said, “I had better hold my
tongue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>I quite agreed in this, for he always got the worst of it,
when he attempted to make light of Kitty; she never said
anything rude, but contrived to roll him up in his own rudeness.
And perhaps it was the liberty of saying what she
pleased, after so many years of snubbing—for the freedom of
their voice must be fresh air to women—which had now set
her up in a liveliness of health, such as no one had ever seen
her show before. For instance, she had always had a soft,
clear colour, not to be quenched by her step-mother’s slaps, nor
even by anxiety about her own Kit; but now ever since she
had married me, there was a richness of bloom on her cheeks, and
a delicate gloss you might almost call it, such as may be seen
in a Tea rose only, when it has been thoroughly well managed.
And now she was wearing her pink chintz wrapper, which
showed the perfection of her form, with little sprigs of flowers
climbing up it, just as if they vied with one another, for the
honour and delight of clinging closer into her. I thought that
I had never seen her look so lovely; and she knew what I
thought, and her soft eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“Can’t stop while you look at one another; should have
to stop all day, if it came to that.” Uncle Corny was crisp in
his style, this morning, because of the frost he expected; “Now,
Mrs. Kit, don’t expect him, till you see him. He will have to
keep the fires up, till ten o’clock, for all I know; and Tabby
will have something good for supper at my place. If you can
come too, it will be all the better; but after all this kick-up of
dust, you will be tired. I never can understand why women
are always dusting; they only make more.”</p>

<p>“We are not going dusting; that shows how little you
know about it, Uncle Corny,” my Kitty replied with proper
spirit; “we are going to have a fine good cleaning, such as you
give your wall-trees with the engine. You insist upon keeping
your trees clean; but you don’t care how dirty your boards are.”</p>

<p>“Boards don’t grow,” my uncle replied, as if that shut her
up altogether.</p>

<p>“Yes, they grow dirty,” she answered in his own short
style; and he only said, “Come along, Kit.”</p>

<p>But he turned back, and kissed her; for he loved her
dearly. And both he and I were glad of it, when we talked
about it afterwards.</p>

<p>Then, as he started with his swinging walk, for he was
proud of his flat back and sound joints, my dear wife came to
the door, and threw her round white arms about my neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
She had turned up her sleeves, to show the earnest purpose in
her figure, and her scolloped apron, trimmed with pink, came
nestling into my waistcoat.</p>

<p>“We have never been apart so long, my pet, since our
wedding-day,” she whispered, and her eyes looked wistful;
“don’t expect me down there now; for I don’t think that he
wants me much. And I shall have something ready for you,
and your new pipe filled, my dear, the one I gave you at Baycliff.
I shall be lonely, I dare say; but I shall have the clock
to tell me when you are certain to be home again. And it is
high time for us to learn to do without one another.”</p>

<p>People talk of presentiments, as if nothing could happen
without them. I only know that I had none; but it almost
seemed as if she had some, being of a quicker mind than I.
And I was glad for many a long day that I kissed her with
true tenderness, and looking back caught one sweet smile from
the corner where the white lilac stood.</p>

<p>All that day I was hard at work, attending to what I had
in hand, with enough of mind to do it well, or at least as well
as in me lay. And these things, when they suit the nature
both enlarge and purify it; so that a man who takes delight in
all these little turns of life, although he may be tried and
harassed by the pest of plaguesome insects, and the shifts of
weather, yet shall do his own heart good, by doing good to what he
loves. Neither shall he find himself in the humour to believe
half the evil that he hears of his old friends; or even to be sure
when he goes to his letter-box, that the bill which he finds
there a month after he has paid it, may not have been sent in
again by pure mistake.</p>

<p>“How you are mooning!” said my Uncle Corny, who often
pretended to be rougher than he was; “that bottom branch
should be at least three inches lower. And do you call that
leader straight? Why, I call it a ram’s horn. How often
must I tell you, that to make sure of your work, you must step
back, and see how it looks across the border? And here’s a
great batch of scale left to hatch at its leisure. A pretty wife
spoiled the best gardener I ever knew. You have been thinking
of Kitty, all the blessed day, I see. But put away your nail-bag,
and let the net down from the coping. What do you
suppose the thermometer is now?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps about forty,” I replied, looking round, for
the sun was gone down in a rich red sky, and the air was very
shrewd, and my fingers getting cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thirty-six already, and will be thirty very soon; and
twenty-two at four o’clock, as sure as I’m a sinner. If we only
pull through this, we shall be all right. There’s a change of
weather coming within twenty-four hours. Come and have a
glass of ale; and then we’ll go and do the bonfires. When we
have done, Tabby will give us a hot chop, and then you will
be home, before Kitty breaks her heart.”</p>

<p>I knew that our bloom, which was now beyond its prime,
had escaped very narrowly the night before, and would be in
still greater peril to-night; for these frosts always strengthen,
until there comes a change. So while he set off with his five-tined
fork, I ran to the house for my glass of beer (which I
really wanted after that long day), and another box of matches,
for he thought that his were damp. And when Mrs. Tapscott
handed me the ale, she asked in a tone which made me feel
uncomfortable—</p>

<p>“Have’e got the gearden door locked vast?”</p>

<p>“What garden door do you mean?” I inquired. “There
are two gates, and there are three doors, Tabby. And what
makes you ask, in that ominous voice?”</p>

<p>“Dun’now what hominous manes,” she replied; “but I
knows what door manes, and so ought you. Old lead-coloured
door, to the back of your ouze.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it must be locked. It always is. None
of our men go that way, you know. But what makes you put
such a question to-night?”</p>

<p>“Dun’now, no more than the dead,” she answered, “only
come into my head, as such things will. Heer’d zummat down
town, as zet me a-thinking. You zee her be locked, when you
goes home.”</p>

<p>Before I could ask her what she had heard, the sound of
my uncle’s impatient shout came through the still air; and I
hurried off to help him, for he had more than he could well do
by himself.</p>

<p>It was deep dusk now, and the night was falling fast.
Venus, on duty as the evening star, shone with unusual size
and sparkle, above the faint gleam which had succeeded the
yellow glow after the red sundown. And a little white vapour
was rising here and there, where the low ground leaned into the
gentle slope; but there was not enough of air on the move to
draw the slow mist into lines, or even to breathe it into any
shape at all.</p>

<p>“Now look sharp!” exclaimed Uncle Corny, who was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
at all concerned with Nature’s doings, except as they concerned
his pocket.</p>

<p>“I understand things; and you don’t. You will see, if you
know north from south, that I have arranged all this in a most
scientific manner. Here are fifty piles on the eastern side of
all these Bonlewin, and fifty on the north. The wind must be
either north or east, when it freezes. We light up, according
to the direction of the wind.”</p>

<p>He wetted one finger at his lips, and held it up according to
some old woman’s nostrum for discovering what way the wind
blows. And I said—“But supposing there is no wind at all?”</p>

<p>“Very well. It doesn’t matter what way it is;” he had
made up his mind, and meant to have it out. “You are full
of objections, because you know nothing. There is no cure for
that, but to do as you are told. You begin at that corner, and
let the air go through. I shall take this line, and see who does
it best.”</p>

<p>“You could never have smoked that Old Arkerate out, in
this sort of weather,” I said; and he laughed, as he always did,
when that triumph was recalled.</p>

<p>“I heard something about him, the other day,” he shouted,
as he was going down the row of piles; “but I can’t stop to tell
you now. Remind me at supper.”</p>

<p>In spite of all that we both could do, and of all his long
preparations, not a whiff of smoke would go near the trees, but
all went up as straight as the trees themselves. And I laughed
very heartily—the last hearty laugh I was to enjoy for many a
day, at the excuses Uncle Corny made for the fume that would
only come into his mouth. But he would not confess himself
beaten; too genuine a Briton was he for that. He stamped
about, and used strong words, and even strove with his broad-flapped
hat, to waft the smoke, which was as stubborn as himself,
into the track it should take; till I told him that he was like
the wise man of Gotham, who shovelled the sunshine into his
barn. Then he laughed, and said,—</p>

<p>“Well, it will be all right, by-and-by. As the frost draws
along, this blessed smoke must come with it. You never
understand the true principles of things. Just come in and
have some supper, and we will have another look at it. You
must never expect a thing to work at first. Other people have
done it, and I mean to do it. It is nothing but downright
obstinacy. Ah there, it begins to go right already! All it
wants is a little common sense and patience.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall go home first,” I said, “and see that all is right.
Kitty has got a bit for me to eat; and perhaps she will come
down with me, in about an hour’s time, if she is not too tired.
You go and have your supper, uncle.”</p>

<p>With this, I set off, having long been uneasy, partly
perhaps at what Tabby had said, and partly at having been so
long from home. But I whistled a tune, and went cheerfully
along, for the night was beautiful, and the trees, still piled with
blossom, rose against the starry sky, like cones of snow.</p>

<p>Our door was wide open, which surprised me just a little,
for my wife was particular about that. Then I went into the
passage, and called—“Kitty, Kitty!” but heard no sweet
voice say, “Yes, dear!” Neither did any form more sweet
than words of kindest greeting come. And my step rang
through the passage with that hollow sound which an empty
house seems to feel along every wall. With a terrible thumping
in my breast, I turned into our little parlour, and struck
against a straggling chair. There was no light burning, the
window was wide open, the curtains undrawn, the room felt
like a well, and the faint light from the sky upon the table
showed that no supper-cloth was laid. Shouting for Kitty,
in a voice of fear which startled myself, I groped my
way to the mantelpiece where the matches stood. They
were in a little ornament which we had brought from
Baycliff; my trembling hand upset it, and they fell upon
the rug. I picked up half a dozen, I struck them anyhow on
the grate, and lit a small wax candle which we had considered
rather grand. The room was in good order, there was nothing to
tell any thing; but I knew that it had not been occupied for hours.</p>

<p>“She is gone,” I exclaimed, though with no one to hear
me; “my Kitty is gone. She is gone for ever.”</p>

<p>I lit the fellow-candle, and left it burning on the table,
while I hurried to the kitchen, though I knew it was in vain.
The kitchen fireplace was gray with cold ashes; there was not
a knife and fork nor a plate set out, and the white deal table
had no cooking-cloth upon it. Then I gave up calling
“Kitty,” as I had been doing all along, till I ran upstairs to
our pretty bedroom; and there I called for her once more.
When there came no answer, I fell upon the bed, and wondered
whether I was mad.</p>

<p>All my wits must have left me in the bitterness of woe.
I seemed even to accept it as a thing to be expected, not to
want to know the reason, but to take it like death. Who I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was, I knew not for the time, nor tried to think; but lay as in
a blank of all things, only conscious of a misery I could not
strive against. I did not even pray to die; for it seemed to
make no difference.</p>

<p>Then up I got, with some sudden change, and the ring of
my heel on the floor, as I struck it without measuring distance,
now echoed in my brain; and anger sent anguish to the right-about.
“This is the enemy’s work,” I cried; “it serves me
right for not wringing their necks, for their cursed tricks at
Hounslow. So help me God, who has made them and me, I
will send them to Him, this time.”</p>

<p>My strength was come back, and the vigour of my limbs,
and the iron control of every nerve. Until the sense of wrong
had touched me, I was but a puling fool. I had felt that all
my life was gone, with her who was the spring of it, and that
nothing lay before me, but to put up my legs and moan. But
praised be the Lord, who has given us that vivid sense of
justice which of all His gifts is noblest, here I stood, a man
again; ready to fight the Devil, and my brethren who are full
of him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />

<small>COLD COMFORT.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the calm May night, I left my desolate home, to learn the
cause and meaning of its desolation. Some men might have
doubted whether it was worth their while to trace the dark
steps of their own reproach. From what I had seen even now,
I knew that my wife had left me of her own accord. There
was not the smallest sign of struggle, or disorder, anywhere;
nothing whatever to suggest that any compulsion had been
used, or even that any stranger’s foot had crossed our humble
threshold. Of this I should learn more by daylight; and I
took care not to slur the chance, by even treading the little path
that led to the old door in the wall. There was a grass edging
to that path, betwixt it and a row of espalier apple trees in full
bloom now; and along that grass I made my way, with a bull’s-eye
lamp in my hand, as far as the leaden-coloured door, of
which old Tabby had asked a few hours ago. Without stepping
in front of that door, I threw the strong light upon it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
perceived at once that it had been opened recently. It was
now unbolted and unlocked, and kept shut only by the old
thumb-latch. This I lifted, and stepped outside, keeping close
to the post, so as not to meddle with any footprints, within or
without. Then I cast my light on the dust outside, for the
weather had lately been quite dry; and there I saw distinctly
the impress of my darling’s foot. I could swear to it among ten
thousand, with its delicate springy curves; for her feet in their
boots had the shapely arch and rise of a small ox-tongue; and
ladies did not wear peg-heels then, to make flat feet seem vaulted.</p>

<p>By the side of that comely footprint were the marks of a
coarser and commonplace shoe, short and square, and as wide as
it was long, probably the sign pedal of a clod-hopping country
boy, or lad. Of these there were some half-dozen, as if the boy
had stamped about as he entered, and repeated the process
when he returned. “I will examine these carefully, when the
sun is up,” thought I; “I must see to other matters now.”</p>

<p>So I hurried at once, by the shortest track, to the lower
corner of the gardens, where my uncle Corny lived. Tabby
Tapscott was gone home, and the house all dark and fast asleep,
for I must have lost an hour in my agony on the bed, besides
all the other time wasted. At last my thunderous knocks
disturbed even the sound sleep of the grower; and he flung up
a window, and looked out, with a nightcap over his frizz of
white hair.</p>

<p>“It is no time for anger,” I replied to his hot exclamations;
“come, and let me in. I want your advice. I am ruined.”</p>

<p>My uncle was thoroughly good at heart; when he came down
with a light, and saw the ghost he had let in, he was very little
better than his visitor. He shook, as if old age were come
upon him suddenly, while I tried to tell my tale.</p>

<p>“My Kitty gone, and gone of her own accord!” he cried, as
if he, and not I, had lost her. “Man, you must be mad. Are
you walking in your sleep?”</p>

<p>“God send that I may be! But when shall I awake?”</p>

<p>The old man’s distress, and his trembling anguish, let loose
all the floods of mine; I fell against the wall, where he hung
his hats and saws, and sobbed like a woman who has lost her
only child.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” he said; “we shall both be ashamed of
this. Your darling is not dead, my boy; but only lured away
by some d——d trick. Don’t blame yourself, or her. I will
answer for her, sooner than I would for myself in this bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
world. You shall have her back again, Kit; you shall have her
back again. There is a God, who never lets us perish, while
we stick to Him.”</p>

<p>“I have not stuck to Him. I have stuck to her.” The
truth of my words came upon me like a flash. It was the first
time I had even thought of this.</p>

<p>“Never mind. He knows; and He meant it so,” my uncle
replied with some theology of his own; “no man will be punished
for doing what the Bible orders. You’ll see, my dear
boy, it will all come right. You will live to laugh at this
infernal trick. And I hope to the Lord, that I shall be alive to
grin with you. Cheer up, old fellow. What would your Kitty
think, to see you knock under to a bit of rigmarole? You must
keep up your spirits for poor Kitty’s sake.”</p>

<p>To see an old man show more pluck than a young one, and
to take in a little of his fine faith, set me on my pins again,
more than any one would believe; and I followed him into his
kitchen, where the remnants of the fire were not quite dead.</p>

<p>“Now blow it up, Kit,” he said; “and put a bit of wood
in. Tabby always leaves it in this cupboard. Ah, that was a
fine tree, that old Jargonel! It lived on its bark, I believe,
for about a score of years, and you helped to split it up, when
you were courting Kitty. You shall court her again, my boy,
and have another honeymoon, as they’ve cut yours short in
this confounded way. Now, make a good fire, while I put
my breeches on. You look like a ghost, that has never had a
bit to eat. And I don’t suppose you have touched a morsel to
speak of, since breakfast. ‘Never say die’ is my motto, Kit.
We’ll be at the Police-office, by three o’clock. We can do
nothing till then, you know.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, his ancient cuckoo sang out one o’clock;
and I obeyed his orders, and even found a little comfort in the
thought, that Kitty would have smiled to see my clumsy efforts;
for she was very knowing about making fires up. When I had
contrived to eat a bit of something, which my uncle warmed
up for me, though I never knew what it was, he gave me a
glass of old ale, and took a drop himself; and we talked of our
calamity, until it was time to go. He asked me whether anything
within the last few days could be called to mind that
bore at all upon this sudden mystery. Whether any jarring
words, however little thought of, had passed between my wife
and me, as is sometimes the case, even when a couple are all
in all to one another. But I could remember none, nor any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
approach to such a thing; and I had never seen a frown upon
my darling’s forehead.</p>

<p>Then he told me what he had heard about his former tenant,
Harker, the man whom he ejected by a fumigating process,
much more successful than the ejectment of the frost. It was
nothing more than this, and even this perhaps a piece of idle
village gossip. Old Arkerate had taken much amiss his tardy
expulsion, for he meant to live rent-free through winter, and
had been heard to say that he would be—something anticipatory
perhaps of his final doom—if that blessed young couple should
be in his house very long. For he knew a trick worth two of
that. And if he had been smoked out, hang them, they should
be burned out.</p>

<p>I agreed with my uncle that such stuff as this was not worth
repeating, especially as nothing of the kind had come to pass;
and yet again it appeared suspicious that the door through which
my dear wife had vanished should be the very one which old
Harker had used for his special entrance and exit; while he
had even been jealous of any attempt on the part of the owners
to use it. But my uncle and myself were uncommonly poor
hands at anything akin to spying. Our rule had always been
to accept small fibs (such as every man receives by the dozen
daily) without passing them through a fine sieve; which if any
man does, he will have little time for any other employment.</p>

<p>“Take this big stick, Kit; I brought it for the purpose,”
said my uncle, when I had knocked a dozen times in vain, at
the door of Sergeant Biggs, our head policeman; “it is the
toughest bit of stuff I have ever handled. It will go through
the panel of the door, before it breaks. Don’t be afraid, my
boy; take both hands; but let me get out of the way, before
you swing it. Ah, that ought to bring him out. But we must
make allowance for the strength of his sleep, because he has
such practice at it, all day long.”</p>

<p>Our police force at that time consisted of two men, Sergeant
Biggs the chief officer, and Constable Turnover; very good
men both, and highly popular. They were not paid by any
means according to their merits; and we always got up a Christmas-box
for them, which put them on their honour not to make
a fuss for nothing. It is wise of every place to keep its policemen
in good humour; otherwise it gets a shocking name, without
deserving it.</p>

<p>“Coming, master, coming. Don’t you be in such a hurry,”
we heard a very reasonable voice reply at last. “Got one leg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
into these here breeches, and can’t get in the other, ’cos they
wasn’t made for me. Ah, there goes that blessed stair into my
bad leg again! They promised to mend it, last Lady Day
twelve-month; but mend it they won’t, till I’ve got a running
sore. Now, gents both, what can I do for you? Always at
the post of duty. That’s the motto of the Force. Why, bless
me, if it isn’t Mr. Orchardson! Any delinquents in your
garden, sir?”</p>

<p>“Ever so much worse than that,” replied my uncle; “Biggs,
are you wide awake? A dreadful thing has happened. Where
is Turnover? We shall want you both at once.”</p>

<p>“On duty, sir; patrolling—unless he have turned in. But
he’s very good for that, when I looks after him. Which I do
pretty sharp, as he knows to his credit. A very active constable
is Turnover. But come inside, Mr. Orchardson. Don’t
stand out in the cold, sir.”</p>

<p>There was a streak of dawn among the trees towards
Hampton, and the white frost-fog had rolled up from the river;
and I saw that a dark cloud was gathering in the south. The
change that my uncle had foretold was coming even sooner
than he had expected it.</p>

<p>We went inside; and Sergeant Biggs, who had a light,
pulled on a coat, and sat down in state before a railed desk, on
which a square book was lying. Then he turned the brass
cover off the ink, and squared his elbows.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, the particulars, if you please. We must make
entry, afore we does nothing. You were quite right in coming
to head-quarters, Mr. Orchardson. Let me see; May the fourteenth,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, Biggs, no. It is morning now; and yesterday was the
fifteenth of May.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, sir. Here it is upon the <i>Standard</i>. May 16th,
1861, 3.30 a.m. by office clock. Information received from
Cornelius Orchardson, of the Fruit-Gardens, Sunbury. Everything
ready, sir. Please to go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Kit, you tell him. You know most about it. Scratch out
‘Cornelius;’ and put ‘Christopher,’ Biggs.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Biggs did not like to disfigure his book. However,
he was a most obliging man. “Stay, sir, stay,” he exclaimed:
“I can do it better and neater than that is. ‘Cornelius
Orchardson, of the Fruit-Gardens, Sunbury, and his nephew
Christopher Orchardson.’ That meets the point exactly. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
then, gentlemen, fire away. And I will reduce it into proper
form.”</p>

<p>Chafing at all this rigmarole, which was sending another
good hour to waste, I poured out my tale in a very few words,
and had the satisfaction of seeing at last an expression of
amazement gathering and deepening on the large fat countenance
of Sergeant Biggs.</p>

<p>“Why this beats everything as was ever done in Sunbury,
since Squire Coldpepper’s daughter ran away! And in the
same family, too, as you might say! How long ago was that?
Why, let me see.” He was going to refer to some books,
and took off his horn spectacles first to consider where they
were.</p>

<p>“Come along, Biggs. No time for that,” cried my uncle
impatiently; “we want you to come and examine the place at
once. It was useless for us to go up, till daylight. There are
footsteps for you to examine, and the doors.”</p>

<p>“Now this here will be all over London, afore the clock strikes
twelve to-day. Ah, you may stare, gentlemen; and we don’t
tell how we do it. But such is our organization, and things
are brought to such perfection now—”</p>

<p>“Come along, Biggs. Why, it’s pouring with rain! I
knew the white frosts were sure to bring it. But I did not
expect it till the afternoon. And it sounds like hail—shocking
thing for all my blossom.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you, Mr. Orchardson, in about ten minutes.
But I must put my toggery to rights first, you see. Sergeant
Biggs does not think much of himself; but Sunbury does, and
it would stare to see him go on duty without any waistcoat or
stock, or even a pair of braces on. By-the-bye, gents, have you
been to Tompkins’ house?”</p>

<p>This was about the first sensible thing he had said; and I
answered that we had not been there yet; but would go there
at once, as it was not far out of our course, and we would
rejoin him at the cottage. I had thought more than once in
the long hours of that night of going to see the girl Polly, but
was loth to knock up a hard-working household for nothing,
and felt sure that Polly could throw no light upon the matter:
as she always left our cottage about five in the afternoon.</p>

<p>And so it proved when we saw her now. For she could
only stare, and exclaim, “Oh Lor’!” having most of her wits,
which were not very active, absorbed in hard work, and the
necessity of living. And the more I examined her, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
nervous she became, fancying that she was undergoing trial,
and perhaps likely to be hanged for the loss of her young
mistress.</p>

<p>“I never see nawbody take her away: nor nawbody come
anigh the house, all the time as I were in it. Mother knows
I didn’t.” This she said over and over again.</p>

<p>“Nobody says that you did, Polly,” I answered as gently
as possible; “but did you see anything to make you think,
that your mistress meant to go away, when you were gone?”</p>

<p>“I don’now what she was athinking of. She never told
me nort about it. No, I never see nawbody take her away.
It isn’t fair, nor true, to say so.”</p>

<p>“But, my good child, nobody supposes that you did. Nobody
is blaming you in the least. Nobody thinks that you saw
her go away. But can’t you tell us whether you saw anything
to show that she was likely to go away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw a big black crow come flying right over the
roof about one o’clock; and then I knowed as some one was
agoing, ’live or dead. But I never told her, feared to frighten
her. Lord in heaven knows I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“And did you see anything else go by? A cat, or a dog, or
a man or a woman, or anything else that did not usually come?
Or did you hear any steps, anywhere near the house, or see anything
more than usual?”</p>

<p>Polly shook her head, as if I was putting a crushing weight
of thought on the top of it. And then she began to cry again,
and her mother came up to protect her. She had cried when
she heard that her mistress was gone; and she must not be
allowed to cry again, or no one could tell what would come of
it.</p>

<p>“Sweetie, tell the whole truth now. Got no need to be
frightened. If perlice does come, they can’t do nothing at all
to you, my dear. Seventeen children have I had, and none
ever put thumb on the Bible.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tompkins did not mean that her family failed to search
the Scriptures, but that they had never been involved in
criminal proceedings; nay, not even as witnesses.</p>

<p>“Well then, I think as I did see summat,” replied Polly
under this encouragement. I would not have pressed her as I
did, unless I had felt pretty sure that she was keeping something
back. “It worn’t nothin’ to speak of much, nor yet to think
upon, at the time.”</p>

<p>“Well, out with it, deary, whatever it was. All you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to do, is to speak the truth, and leave them as can put two and
two together, to make out the meaning of it.”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Polly, after one more glance to be sure that
no policeman was coming, told her tale. It was not very much,
but it might mean something.</p>

<p>“’Twur about four o’clock, I believe, and all the things
was put back again after mucksing out the rooms, when missus
said to me, ‘You run, Polly, and pick a little bit of chive down
the walk there. I don’t want much,’ she says, ‘but what there
is must be good, and just enough to cover a penny-piece, after
I’ve chopped it up and put it together. I wants to have everything
ready,’ she says, ‘just to make a homily when my husband
comes home. I have got plenty of parsley in that cup,’
she says, ‘but he always likes a little bit of chive, to give it
seasoning. And be sure you pick it clean,’ she says, ‘and it
musn’t be yellow at the tip, or dirty, because if the grit gets in,’
she says, ‘it’s ever so much worse than having none at all.’
So I says, ‘All right, ma’am, I knows where it is; and you
shall have the best bit out of all the row.’ ‘You’re a good girl,’
she says, ‘don’t be longer than you can help, and you shall
have a cup of tea, Polly, before you go home, because you’ve
worked very well to-day; nobody could ’a doed it better,’ says
she. Well, I took a little punnet as was hanging in the kitchen,
not to make it hot in my hands, you see, and I went along the
grass by the gooseberry bushes,—you knows the place I mean,
mother; and there was the chives, all as green as little leeks.
As I was a-stooping over them, with my back up to the sky, all
of a sudden I heer’d a sort of creak like, as made me stand up
and look to know where it come from. And then I seed the
old door, as used to be bolted always, opening just a little way,
in towards me, though I was a good bit off; and then the brim
of a hat come through, and I sings out, ‘Who’s there, please?’
There wasn’t no nose or eyes a-coming through the door yet;
nor yet any legs, so far as I could see; but only that there
brim, like the brim of a soft hat; and I couldn’t say for certain
whether it were brown or black. ‘Nothing here to steal,’ I
says, for I thought it wor some tramp; and then the door shut
softly, and I was half a mind to go and see, whether there was
any one out in the lane. But it all began to look so lonely like,
and I was ordered not to stop, and so I thought the best thing
was to go back, and tell the missus. But something came that
drove it out of my mind altogether. For when I got back to
the house she says, ‘Don’t you lose a minute, Polly, that’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
good girl. Run as far as Widow Cutthumb’s, and fetch half a
dozen eggs. I thought I had four, and I have only got three,’
she says, ‘and I can’t make a homily for two people of three
eggs. And my husband won’t eat a bit, unless I has some,’ she
says.</p>

<p>“So I was off quick stick to Widow Cutthumb’s; and
there, outside the door, I seen that Bat Osborne, the most
owdacious boy in all Sunbury. ‘Halloa!’ says he, ‘Poll, you
do look stunnin’. Got a baker’s roll a-risin’, by the way you
be a-pantin’! Give us a lock of your hair, again’ the time
when we gets old,’ he says. And afore I could give him a box
on his ear, out he spreads his fingers, some way he must have
learned—for I never could ’a doed it myself, no, that I couldn’t—and
away goes all my black-hair down over all my shoulders,
just the same as if it was Sunday going on for three years
back. That vexed I were, I can assure you, Mr. Kit—well,
mother knows best how I put it up that very same morning for
the cleaning, and our Annie to hold the black pins for me—but
get at him I couldn’t, to give him one for himself. He
were half across the street, afore I could see out; and he
hollered out some imperence as made all the others grinny.
But I’ll have my change, afore next Sunday week, I will.</p>

<p>“When I got back, Mr. Kit, you may suppose, all about
the door and the hat-brim was gone clean out of my mind, as
if it never was there; and I come away home, without a word
about it, and never thought of it nother, till I lay awake in bed
and heered our own door creak, when father went to spy the
weather. But oh, if I had only thought about it, Mr. Kit,
perhaps missus mightn’t never ’a been took off!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />

<small>NONE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> this beginning of my great trouble, I used to be worried,
more than common sense would warrant, by the easy way in
which other people took my distress, even while I was among
them. If anything occurred to make them laugh, they laughed
with all their hearts at things, in which I could perceive no
joke at all. I dare say they were right, and I was wrong;
but I felt that I should not have laughed at all, if the tables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
had been turned upon them, as I wished they had been. That
is to say, if they had been in bitter grief, and I had been standing
outside to help them. For the policemen I could make all
allowance, because they must get seasoned by their profession,
even as the lawyers do; but it did seem a little bit unnatural at
first, that some men, to whom I would gladly have lent my last
shilling but one, if they had wanted it, should be ready to put
their hands into their pockets, not to feel if there was anything
there for my good, but to enable them to enjoy a broad grin
at leisure, if the least bit of laughable nature turned up. But
one thing I will say for the women, there was scarcely so much
as a smile among them; they could understand what I had
lost, and they knew (perhaps from self-examination) that a
good wife is not to be got every day.</p>

<p>The heavy cloud had been pouring down rain in volumes
and hail in lines, when with Selsey Bill, and Mrs. Bill, and
Polly lagging after us under a broken umbrella, my uncle and
myself came to Honeysuckle Cottage and found Sergeant Biggs
and Constable Turnover, with their oilskin capes running like
a tiled roof, and their faces full of discipline.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t go inside, gents, till you came; no warrant
being out, and no instructions received. Always gets into
trouble, when we acts on our own hook.”</p>

<p>We led them inside, for there was broad day-light now, and
the cloud began to lift, and the rain came down in single drops,
instead of one great sheet. As they stamped about and shook
themselves in our little passage, scattering grimy wetness like
a trundled mop, I wondered, with a bitter pang, what Kitty
would have thought after all her neat work, if she could only
have seen this.</p>

<p>“Turnover, you come after me. We makes this inspection
together, mind. And what I sees, you sees, and corroborates.
Though it ain’t a case of murder, so far as we know yet, we
must keep our eyes open, the same as if it was. Everything
comes to us, and nothing comes amiss to them that does their
duty.”</p>

<p>This sentiment was much admired by Constable Turnover;
and my uncle whispered, “Let them do exactly as they like,
Kit. They are a pair of fools; but we need not tell them so.
We shall have them on our side, at any rate. And if they don’t
do any good, they can do no harm. Leave them entirely to
their own devices.”</p>

<p>This quite agreed with my own view of the matter. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
a crime has been committed, we call in the police, as in
dangerous illness we invoke a doctor, for the satisfaction of our
own minds, rather than from any hope of being helped. And
in the former case, we have this advantage—the thing becomes
widely spread, and distant eyes are turned on it.</p>

<p>“All in order, gents; not a lock been forced, not a door
broke open, so far as we can discover.” Sergeant Biggs was
beating his hands together, from the force of habit, as he came
to us in the kitchen, where we were sitting drowsily. “Two
windows open, and some rain come in; but no signs of entrance
by them. The young lady have gone of her own accord, and
left no sign for any one. Time of disappearance not exactly
known, you say, but somewhere between five and ten o’clock
supposed. Please give particulars of dress, height, and complexion.
We know the young lady well enough, of course, but
we like to have those things from relatives. And the dress is
beyond us; ladies always are so changing. Mr. Kit says her
gray cloak is gone, and brown bonnet. White chip hat hanging
on the peg. Looks as if she meant to go a goodish way. But
not much preparation for travelling. There was a little black
bag, sir, you said you could not find. Very sorry to trouble
you, sir, when you are so down-hearted. But I must ask you
just to look into them drawers in the lady’s bedroom. And
specially to see if any cash is missing. Excuse me, sir, I
meant no rudeness.”</p>

<p>For I had leaped up, and was ready to strike him, at the
suggestion that my darling could have robbed me.</p>

<p>“He is doing his duty, Kit; don’t be a fool;” cried my
uncle, as Biggs threw his arm up in defence.</p>

<p>“Must give up this case, sir,” said the sergeant, without
anger; “unless you allows us to conduct it our own way. We
are bound to know all that can throw a light upon it. And
nine times out of ten, when a woman—beg pardon—a lady
runs away from her husband on the sudden, she collars all the
cash, and all the trinkets she can find. Don’t mean to insinuate
for a moment that this young lady done anything of the
kind. But for all that, I am bound to put the question; and
Mr. Cornelius can see it, if you can’t, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will go and see,” I answered, having sense
enough to know that he was right; “and you can both come
and see for yourselves, if you like. Perhaps you won’t believe
it, unless you do. At any rate, you come, Uncle Corny.”</p>

<p>I ran up in haste to our little bedroom, as pretty a room as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
one could wish to see, for its cheerfulness, airiness, and fair
view, between the clustering climbers, of the broad winding
river and the hills beyond, all to be seen either over or amid a
great waving depth of white and pink, where the snow of the
pears put the apples to the blush. Very plainly furnished as
it was, our little room looked sweet, even in its desolation, and
as lively and delightful as the bride who had adorned it. My
Aunt Parslow had given us a pretty chest of drawers, of real
bird’s-eye maple-wood, which she had bought at a sale somewhere;
and we kept all our money, that was not at the bank,
in one of the top drawers, which had a tolerable lock. This
was the proper place for Kitty’s purse and mine; although I
never had one, so to speak—at least it was always empty.
Whenever I had any money, fit to spend, it was generally
always in my waistcoat-pocket; and it never stopped there long,
if I came across anybody who deserved it. But I never went
out with too much at a time; for it is not safe to have nothing
left at home. The key was not in the drawer, of course; but I
knew where Kitty kept it, and there it was, as usual.</p>

<p>I could have wept now, if I might have made sure of nobody
coming after me, when I found all the balance of this
week’s allowance for housekeeping uses in a twist of silver
paper—such as used to be common, but is seldom seen now;
and my darling had not made much boot upon the store, ever
since last Saturday. For our butcher, who wanted her to run
up an account (being in love with her, as everybody was,
although he had a wife and seven little butchers rising), had
made believe that he could not stop to weigh the last half-leg
of mutton he sent up. Kitty had told me of this, and lamented,
while unwilling to appear distrustful of him. For an honest
tradesman dislikes that, though he often has to brace up his
mind to it.</p>

<p>I put this residue of our fifteen shillings into one corner, as
a sacred thing; and then I went to the brown metal box at the
back of the drawer, where we kept our main stock, with a
dozen of my wife’s new handkerchiefs piled over it, to delude
all burglars. I had bought her a dozen, at less than cost price,
as the haberdasher vowed, at Baycliff; and we had been reluctant
to be so hard upon him; but he said that he was selling
off, and we must have the benefit. And I lifted them now
with a miserable pang; for my love had kissed me, for this
cheap but pretty present, and she had marked them all with
her own sweet hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>I have often been astonished in my life, as everybody must
be, almost before his hair begins to grow; but mine (which was
now in abundant short curls) would have pushed off my hat, if
I had worn one, when the money-box came to my eyes, half
open, and as clean as a spade on a Saturday night. Every
bank-note was gone, and every sovereign, too, and even the four
half-sovereigns, which we had meant to spend first, when we
could not help it!</p>

<p>I have never loved money with much of my heart, though
we are bound to do as our neighbours do; and perhaps it had
been a little pleasure to me, to have more than I ever could
have dreamed of having, through the great generosity of Aunt
Parslow, and the timely assistance of Captain Fairthorn. But
now my whole heart went down in a lump, and I scarcely had
any power of breath, as I fell once more upon my widowed bed,
and had no strength to wrestle with the woe that lay upon me.
That my own wife, my own true wife, the heart of my heart,
and the life of my life, should have run away from me, of her
own accord, without a word, without one good-bye, and carried
off all our money!</p>

<p>“Come, Kit, how much longer do you mean to be?” my
uncle’s voice came up the stairs. “Let him alone, Biggs.
Perhaps he is crying. Those young fellows never understand
the world. Some little thing comes round a corner on them,
and they give way, for want of seasoning. He was wonderfully
bound up in his Kitty. And however it may look against her
now, I will stake my life that she deserved it. You Peelers
see all the worst of the world, and it makes you look black at
everything. I would lay every penny I possess, which is very
little in these free-trade times, that he finds every farthing of
his money right. Though I have often told him what a fool
he was to keep so much in his own house.”</p>

<p>“He seems an uncommon time a-counting of it.” Sergeant
Biggs spoke sceptically, and retired to the kitchen; for it did
not matter very much to him.</p>

<p>Getting no reply from me, my uncle came up slowly; for a
night out of bed tells upon the stiff joints, when a man is getting
on in years. Then he marched up bravely, and laid one hand
upon my shoulder.</p>

<p>“What are you about, Kit? Breaking down, old fellow!
You must not do that, with these chaps in the house, or the
Lord knows what a lot of lies will get about. Money all right,
of course. No doubt of that, my boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>I could make no answer, but pointed to the drawer, which
was still pulled out to its full extent. With a little smile,
which expressed as well as words—“What a fool you must be,
to keep your money there!” he looked in, and saw the empty
cash-box, and turned as white as his own pear-blossom. Then
he took the brown box in his thick right hand, and turned it
upside down, as if he could not trust his eyes.</p>

<p>“How much was there in it? But perhaps you did not know?
Oh, Kit, Kit, is it come to this at last?”</p>

<p>He spoke as if I ought to have been robbed by my own
wife, a long time ago, and was bound by the duty of a husband
to expect it. But my spirit rose, and I jumped up, and faced
him.</p>

<p>“Every farthing of it was her own,” I said; “and she had
a perfect right to take it. It is part of the hundred pounds
Aunt Parslow gave her, on our—on her wedding-day. There
was forty-five pounds in that box; and the other fifty-five was
invested according to your advice. I would send her that also,
if I knew her address. It was all her own money; you may
ask Aunt Parslow. I have no right to a farthing of it.”</p>

<p>“Kit, you are a very fine fellow after all, though you do
take things so lumpily. But answer me one little question.
Why did your aunt give her that hundred pounds?”</p>

<p>“Because she loved her, as everybody does—or did.
Because she was so kind, and good, and loving.”</p>

<p>“No, my boy, not at all for that reason. But because she
married you, Aunt Parslow’s nephew. The money was yours,
in all honesty, not hers. Or at any rate it belonged to you
together. She had no more right to take that money without
your consent, than I have to walk into Baker Rasp’s shop, and
walk out of it with the contents of his till. You must look at
things squarely, and make your mind up. Expel her from
your heart. She is a light-of-love, and a robber. Oh, Kit,
Kit, that I should have brought you into this! And I did
think that I knew so much about women.”</p>

<p>My uncle shed a tear, not on his own account, or mine, and
perhaps not even for the sake of women; but because he had
loved Kitty as his own daughter, and he could no more expel
her from his heart, than I from mine; at least without taking
a long time about it. I was moved with his grief, for he was
hard to grieve; and my wrath at his injustice was disarmed.
I put back the empty box, and locked the drawer; for I knew
that it was useless to argue with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is the second great grief of my life,” he said in a low
voice, as if talking to himself; “over and above those losses
which are inflicted on us by the Lord, as time goes on. And
the other was through a woman too. I will tell you of it, when
we have more time; for it may help you in your own grief, Kit.
But now we must quiet those fellows downstairs. I wish we
had never called them in. I would rather lose every penny I
possess, and start in the world again, as a market-porter, than
let this miserable story get abroad. We must take your view
of the case before the public, and tell them that there is no
money gone, except her own. The Lord knows that I am not
a liar, and He will forgive me for stretching a bit this time.
Or perhaps you had better do it; because you believe it, you
know, and so there won’t be any lie at all. You go down
first; and I will come behind you grumbling, which no one
can say is an ungrateful thing now.”</p>

<p>This seemed the proper course, although in my misery I
should never have thought of it, until I wished that I had done
so. The question as to the right to that money lay between
myself and Kitty; and as she had doubtless considered it hers,
to brand her at large as a robber, without allowing her chance
of explanation, would be most unfair, and would only
add another pain to a story too painful already. So I went
down and told Sergeant Biggs that my wife had taken a few
clothes in her handbag, and a part of some money she had
lately received as a wedding-present, but had left the balance
of her cash for housekeeping, as well as most of her trinkets,
in the bedroom drawer.</p>

<p>He was much disappointed at this, and shook his head, to
disguise the blow received by his sagacity.</p>

<p>“Beats me for the present, at any rate,” he said; “but
time will throw more light upon it, before we are many years
older. You hold on, sir, and not go about too much. Half
the mischief comes of that. A party comes to us, and he says—‘Look
here, I leave the whole of it to your care, sergeant.
You understand these things, and I don’t. Anything as you
do I will back up—magistrates, witnesses, lawyers, dogstealers—whatever
you find needful, up to a five-pound note, or more.’
And after that, what do we feel? Why, ready to go through
with it, on our best mettle, you might say, and come down
with cash out of our own breeches’ pocket, for love of nothing
else but duty. And then we gets crossed, like two dogs a-coursing,
by the other party’s track, with his nose up in the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the very same as if he never come anigh us. So I says to
Turnover, ‘Now one thing or the other; either they must let
us do it all, or nothing. And if we do it all, in a hunt-the-slipper
thing like this, we must know all the ins and outs, first
from the beginning. Then,’ says I, ‘we can give our minds to
it, Turnover.’ And he answers—‘Yes, sergeant, but do they
mean to tell us everything?’ And now that’s the question
before you, sir.”</p>

<p>“We will think about that, and let you know by-and-by,”
said my uncle, who had listened to this long oration; “not
that you ever find out anything, Biggs. Still it is a comfort to
believe that you are trying. And now come and do what you
ought to have done long ago—make a careful examination of
the footprints by the door. It has been raining pretty sharp;
but it all came from the south, and the important marks are on
the north side in the lane, according to what my nephew saw
last night, and the shower won’t have touched them, with the
door shut to. Bring some paper and a pencil, and your old
joint-rule, Kit. Not that we shall ever make out much.”</p>

<p>He was right enough in that last prediction. For although
I had fastened the door—in strict keeping with the moral of
the proverb—and no rain had pelted the ground outside it, yet
a greater effacer than rain had been there. For the spot being
on a sharp slope, and below the crown of the road, or the lane
I should say, a strong rush of water had taken track there, and
washed away all the dust, and then the heavier substance,
leaving rough pebbles with sharp edges sticking up, as clean
and unconscious as before they saw the world.</p>

<p>“Nothing to be made of that,” said Biggs; “nor of any
footmarks anywhere else, after all the rain as have fallen. Only
one thing to do now is to inquire of the neighbours, and folk as
were about last night.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />

<small>ON TWO CHAIRS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> as much as three weeks I had been full of pride, in taking
my Kitty about everywhere—even by the seaside, where I
knew very little, but luckily she knew less, in spite of her
scientific origin—and asking her to look about and see things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with her own eyes; and if she could not make them out, to
call me in to help her. This had been rash on my part; for a
man may be gaping about, for his lifetime, and die after all with
his mouth wide open; and not a word come from it, to help
the people left behind, but only to unsettle them, and put them
in a flutter; as gnats skip into another dance, at every new
breath across them. But Kitty had really put some questions
far outside my knowledge (as a child may, who hangs on his
grandfather’s thumb), and I had promised to look up those
points and deliver an opinion, when I had one. All this came
into my mind, like a chill, when I had to trace her dear steps,
away from me, away from me.</p>

<p>Let seventy times seven wise men say that no man with a
grain of wisdom could have a spark of faith in women, because
they never know their own mind—little as there is of it to
know—I still abode in my own faith, and let them quote old
saws against the sturdy holdfast of true love. I felt as sure of
my Kitty’s heart, as I did of my own, and more so; for she
never would have borne to hear a hundredth part of the things
against me, which I had to listen to against her. And the
cowards, who vent their own craven souls in slander of those
who cannot face them, had a fine time of it now, and rejoiced
in the misery they were too small to feel. Such things might
sour a weakling, who depends upon what other people think;
but I found enough of manhood coming up in me, as time
went on, to make me stick to my own trust, and let outer
opinions touch my home, no more than the shower that runs
down the glass.</p>

<p>At first, however, it was dreadful work. Everybody
seemed to be against me, not with any unkindness, but by way
of worldly wisdom. “Don’t you dwell too much upon it.”
“A runaway wife isn’t worth running after.” “Never you
mind; but get another; try the people you know, with their
friends in the place.” These were the counsels I received,
with a nod of my head, and no reply.</p>

<p>But I could not see things as others saw them. I spent
the first day of my lonely life, in wandering through the crooked
lanes, and working out every track and turn which my darling
could have taken, in the dark mystery of her flight from me.
Very often I thought that she must come back; and there was
scarcely a hill that I did not run up, persuading myself that
when the top was gained, there I should descry her in the
distance beyond, weary, and dragging her feet along, but eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
at sight of me to make a rush and fall into my longing arms.
How many a corner I turned, believing that it must be the last
between her and me; and how many a footpath stile I sat on,
hiding my eyes that she might catch me unawares, as at blind-man’s
buff, and throw her warm arms round my neck, and kiss
me into shame of my mistrust, and tell me that she never
could have doubted me, whatever I had done, or whatever
people said!</p>

<p>And then, when it grew too dark to see even my own love
in the shadow of the lanes, and the last note of the wedded
thrush (who sings to the sparkle of the stars in May) was
hushed by a call from his nest, and followed by the first clear
trill of the nightingale—</p>

<p class="unindent">—weary, and with little heart for loneliness and doubt and woe,
yet I could not be quite sure that when I opened our own door
some one might not run out hotly, and give me no time to
speak, but hold me lip to lip, and breast to breast, with scarcely
room for a tear between us.</p>

<p>It is the emptiness that follows such full hope that does the
harm to the powers of endurance. When no one came to meet
me, and the cold rooms showed grey lines of shade, with no
dear life to cross them, I used to fall away, and feel my heart
go down, like the water of a sink, when the plug is taken out
of it. There was nothing more for it to do. My wretched life
was not worth the fuss of pumping and of labouring; better to
give in at once, and have no more pain to drain it.</p>

<p>“You are killing yourself up here, my boy; this will never
do,” said Uncle Corny. “Bother the women; what a pest
they are! Try to be like that ancient fellow—I can never
remember his name, but they call him the father of history.
You told me about him, when you went to the Grammar-school
at Hampton. And it was so wise that I paid for another half-year
for you to read him. You know better than I do; but I
think there had been a lot of carrying off of pretty girls between
two countries, and they were going to fight about them. But
he says that they had no call to do it; for men of discretion
would let them go, and make no fuss about them. Because it
was manifest that the women would never have been carried off,
unless they themselves had wished it. I don’t suppose you
could do it now; but if you can, bring down the book, and read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
it to me this evening. It would do you a deal more good than
to hold your tongue, and eat your heart out.”</p>

<p>“I hate to hear of that rubbish,” I replied; “they were a
lot of good-for-nothings. To talk of my Kitty in that sort of
way would drive me mad, Uncle Corny. If you have nothing
better to say than that, you had better go home to
Tabby.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps they will come and carry Tabby off. I
believe she would go for a new bonnet; and I don’t know what
I should do if she did. But shut up this place, Kit, and come
back to the old quarters. You want company, my boy; and
I’d rather let old Harker in again than have you here killing
yourself like that, and sleeping in the kitchen on two chairs; if
you ever get any sleep at all.”</p>

<p>“I will never leave this house,” I said; “and I won’t even
be smoked out of it. When Kitty comes back, she will come
here first; and there is no telling how soon she may want me.
You only bother me with all this stuff.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will not be hard upon you, Kit; because the Lord
has done that quite enough. But you have not got a bit of
religion in you, after all the teaching I have given you.”</p>

<p>This was very fine from Uncle Corny, who never even went
to church, except to keep other people out of his pew. And he
rubbed his nose as he said it; as he always did, when he had
gone too far.</p>

<p>“There is a very good man wants to see you,” he went on a
little nervously, for I knew that he had been leading up to
something; “and a man to whom you are bound to listen, because
he was the one who married you, and therefore understands
all the subject, matrimony, women, and the doctrines of the
Church. The Reverend Peter Golightly wishes to have a little
talk with you.”</p>

<p>“And I wish to have none with him. He is a very good
and kind-hearted man. But I could not bear to hear his voice,
after—after what he did for me, and Kitty.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid there would be that objection,” my uncle
answered kindly; “but you will get over that by-and-by, my
boy. And it would be rude not to see him, for he takes the
greatest interest in your case. He has been disappointed himself,
I believe; though of course he did not tell me so. He is
too much a man for that sort of thing. I shall go and hear
him preach some day, unless our vicar comes back again. They
tell me that he does a lot of good, and he preached against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
robbing orchards once, although he has only got one apple tree,
and it is eaten up with American blight. There’s another fellow
wants to see you too—not much of the parson about him. He
can tell you things you ought to know; and being about as he
always is, I wonder you have not been to see him. Not that I
care for Sam Henderson; but he is not so bad as he used to be.
He is going to be married next month; and I’ll be bound he
won’t let his wife—”</p>

<p>“Run away from him—you were going to say. Perhaps he
will not be able to help himself. Well, I will see him, if he
likes to come. I shall be back by nine o’clock. It is very kind
of him to wish it. But send up a bottle of whisky, uncle. I
have no drink of any sort in the house; and Sam is nothing
without his glass, although he never takes very much. I must
give him something, if he comes.”</p>

<p>“And take a drop yourself, my boy, if only for a little
change. I don’t hold with cold water, when a fellow is so
down; though it is better than the opposite extreme. I suppose,
by-the-bye, that your Kitty has not taken—”</p>

<p>“Uncle Corny!” I cried, in a voice that made him jump;
“what next will you imagine? She never touched anything,
not even beer; though I often tried to make her take a glass.
She had seen too much of that, where she was.”</p>

<p>“All right, Kit. But you are getting very cross; which is
not the proper lesson of affliction, as the Reverend Peter might
express it. Well, I’ll send little Bill up, with the bottle and a
corkscrew. I don’t suppose you know where to find anything
now. That’s the worst of married life even for three weeks.
But I have got a plan I mean to tell you of to-morrow.”</p>

<p>When I came back, a little after dark, having finished that
hopeless wandering which I went through every evening now,
there was Sam Henderson, sitting on an empty flower-pot outside
my door, with a cigar in his mouth. He might have gone
inside, for I left the front door open all day long and all night
too, unless the weather prevented it, for I had nothing to be
robbed of now; at least nothing that I cared about, except
Kitty’s clothes, which I had locked out of sight. And it
seemed to be delicate and kind of Sam, to sit here in discomfort,
instead of walking in. And he showed another piece of
good taste and good will, which could hardly be expected from
so blunt and rough a man—he said not a word about his own
bright prospects, until I inquired about them.</p>

<p>But he shook my hand in a very friendly way, and left me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to begin upon the matter which had brought me to my present
state. And for some time I also avoided that.</p>

<p>“I will tell you, old chap,” he said at last, in reply to my
anxious question, “exactly what I think, though it is not good
for much, being altogether out of my own line. I think you
have been awfully wronged, as abominably wronged as any
fellow ever was, on the face of this earth—which is saying a
good bit, mind you. Knowing what a lot of infernal rogues
there are to be found at every corner, and much more often than
decent fellows, I am never brought up standing by any black
job; though the ins and outs of it may floor me. The Professor
is a soft man, isn’t he? He has shown it in many ways,
although he is so clever. You would call him a soft man,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, wondering how this could bear upon it, “I
suppose he is rather of the credulous order, as most good men
are, who measure others by themselves. But he had left England
long before. So that can have little to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, as concerns himself. But I am a believer
in breed, my friend. And the longer I live, the more true I
find it come. A credulous father, if you prefer the word, is
likely to be blest with a credulous child, and your wife took
after her father more closely in the inner, because she didn’t
in the outer woman. At least, I can’t say from my own eyes,
knowing nothing of old Blowpipes, but I understand she did
not favour him in the flesh.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” I answered, with a little smile, as I thought
of the loveliness of Kitty’s face; “but she was like him a little
just here and there.”</p>

<p>“A little won’t do. My old <i>Trunnion</i>, who croaked in the
great frost that almost settled you, my boy, has a son of his old
age, <i>Commodore</i>, who will be heard of towards July at the
market, scarcely a bit like him in the face, except in one tuck
of his nostril, and a tuft of five hairs over his near eye. But
do you think I could not swear to him by his ways and tricks,
and his style of coming up? That’s the time to know what a
horse thinks of you; and I tell you this colt thinks exactly as
his father did; and all the more because he isn’t like him in
the face. There must be the likeness somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard you say that many times before, and I
daresay you are right enough about it. But what has that to
do with—what has happened to me?”</p>

<p>“Just everything, stupid. Your wife being soft—or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
credulous, if you like it better—she sucks in a lot of lies against
you. The dose comes from somebody she believes in, not her
old enemies, of course. Her dignity will not allow her to
complain—women are always horribly dignified when jealous—and
off she goes, without a word, leaving you to your own conscience
which will more than give you the tip for it. She’ll come
back by-and-by, when she has punished you enough; and then of
course you’ll have to swear, etc., etc. She’ll call herself
all sorts of names. And there’ll be nobody like you, till next
time. You’ll see if that isn’t at the bottom of all this.”</p>

<p>“Not likely,” I answered with some wrath. “In the first
place, my Kitty would never believe a word of such stuff against
me, and there is no such thing as jealousy in her nature.”</p>

<p>“You know best. But I thought I heard something from
the man round the corner at Ludred.”</p>

<p>“That was a different thing altogether,” I said quickly,
although the remembrance struck me, as it had not done before;
“and in the next place, if she could be so absurd, she would
be the last person in the world to go away without a word, without
even giving me a chance of taking my own part. No, that
theory will never do. My Kitty was the most just, as well as
the kindest darling ever born.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what they are sometimes. How can you
expect to know more about them than they do about themselves?
Yesterday, just by way of something, I asked Sally
what she would do, if she ever turned up jealous. ‘I would
grind my ring-finger off,’ she said, ‘with these two teeth, I
would, Sam’—for she has got uncommon grinders—‘and I
would make my rival swallow it.’ Now, Sally has been well
broken in, remember, and no vice in the family; at any rate
since her great grand-dam; but her eyes showed that she would
do it!”</p>

<p>“There is no ferocity in Kitty,” I answered with a lofty air;
“I know nothing about race-horses, and very little about women.
But women are only men in a better form, more gentle, more
just, and more loving. They never give way to such fury as
we do—”</p>

<p>“The Professor’s wife, for instance, Kit. She never gives
way to her temper, does she? Oh dear, no. Even if she has
any temper to give way to. A sucking dove—too mild to suck,
if her sister wants the pigeon’s milk before her.”</p>

<p>“She is the exception that proves the rule. And I doubt
whether even she would be so, if she did not suck too much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
stronger liquor. And I will tell you another thing, Master
Sam, as you have put me up to this; and you have a right to
know everything now, that you may understand the case. It
knocks your theory on the head. Only I must have your
solemn promise that no one shall ever hear of it.”</p>

<p>Sam gave me his pledge; and I knew that he would keep
it, for he was well inured to control his tongue. Then I told
him, although it went much against the grain, of the disappearance
of our stock of money.</p>

<p>“That beats me; at least for the present,” he replied; “it
don’t seem to square with anything. Throws me out of my
stride, and makes me cross my legs. But I don’t believe she
ever took it. How can you tell that she took it, poor chap?
If she collared that tin, she will never come back. Was there
nobody else could have taken it? The Peelers, for instance,
you know what they are? They had the run of the house.
I have known a lot of cases—”</p>

<p>“No, it is impossible that they can have touched it. The
lock had not been tampered with. The key was in its place,
and the last place they would have searched for it. And I
know by the state of the drawer, that no hand but my wife’s
had been inside it.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better not call her your wife any more.”
Sam Henderson spoke very sternly; and then, looking at my
face, went on more kindly, and with a huskiness in his voice,
“You have been unlucky, old chap, as unlucky as any fellow
I ever came across, except an old man at New York races once.
It was not about money his bad luck was; or I would not
compare it with yours, my dear boy. Sorry as I was for your
trouble, Kit, I thought it could all be cured, till now. And it
can be cured even now, dear Kit; but only as we cure the grief
of death. I need not tell you to be a man; for I see that you
have been one all along. After what you have told me, I
understand your behaviour thoroughly. Before that, I was
angry with you, and a little ashamed of you, to tell the truth,
for moping here in this way. I thought, ‘Why the deuce
doesn’t he go up and shake the truth out of that old rogue
Hotchpot, or that bigger villain, Downy Bulwrag?’ But now
I see that you could only stay at home, and trust to time to
comfort you. And you must weed out, as I would a filly with
three legs, a bad lot, a woman who—”</p>

<p>“Stop, Sam,” I cried, “don’t say a word that would
make me hate you. Though all appearances are so black, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
will never for a moment lose my faith in Kitty. Nobody
knows her, as I do. If I never see, or hear of her again, I
will say to my last breath, and feel to my last pulse, that she
has been deceived, not by me, but about me; and that I have
never been deceived in her.”</p>

<p>“Well, old chap, all that I can say is, that you deserve a
better wife than was ever yet born. And if your opinion of
your wife is true, why, this affair beats any job on the turf,
that I ever heard of; and I have heard of a smart few. But I
shall keep my eyes open, Kit, and we’ll try to pull it off. I
pick up a lot of things you would never think of; and there’s
daylight at the bottom of the best tarred sack. Come and see
me to-morrow. It will be a little change. And I can show
you a young ’un that will take the shine out of all Chalker’s.
If you want a pot of money, I can tell you where to get it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.<br />

<small>JOB’S COMFORT.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I did</span> not want any pot of money. And even if I had been
filled with that general desire, Henderson’s suggestion would
have had no charm for me. But I resolved to do a much
wiser thing—to stick to my work, with head and hands, and
let the heart come after them, if it could, as it grew wiser.
The police had made nothing of my case, although they had
done their best, no doubt. Whoever had compassed my wife’s
departure—for I would not call it “flight”—had managed
it with much craft; and luck (according to the ancient proverb)
had shown a kinsman’s love for craft. The lane, at the back
of our lonely cottage, was little frequented, except on Sundays,
and then in the evening only, for that study of mutual tastes
and feelings, which is known as “keeping company.” For
this it was a popular resort, and therefore (as usual) called
“Love Lane,” by blushing youth and maiden. At other times
its chief use was to give access to some meadow-land, and its
chief wayfarers were four cows, a donkey, and a nanny-goat,
belonging to Farmer Osborne. But it wound into divers
other lanes, towards Hampton, Tangley Park, and Bedfont,
and through some of them to Feltham Station, on the London
and South-Western line. That was one of the places where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
I had made first inquiry; but Sergeant Biggs had been before
me, and so he had at Twickenham. And in fact he had
sought far and near, and been put upon false scent sometimes,
but had hit on nothing genuine.</p>

<p>Whatever any man may say, or even think, or dream of,
the opinions of his fellow-men go into his mind, and work
there. No one is certain what he believes; or at any rate how
he believes it. And the harder he toils to establish his faith,
the more apt he is to undermine it. His best plan is never to
argue about whatever he longs to trust in; or if his good
friends will not let him alone, he should choose for his
disputant the sceptic. This will build him up a good deal;
not because he has convinced the other man, but because he
knows that he must have done so, if the other had been gifted
with reason.</p>

<p>And now I was more convinced than ever, by the firm
convictions of my uncle, and Sam, that they both were quite
wrong, and that I was quite right. If they had only said that
there might be some mistake, something that admitted of a
simple explanation, and with patience on our part must receive
it, in that case the chances are that I should have been
doubtful whether they had any grounds for putting it in that
way. But when they came and put it—without asking my
opinion—in the very opposite way to that, and the opposite
one to what I wanted to believe, their conclusion was a spring-board
to send me heels over head to the counter one.</p>

<p>My good Aunt Parslow had been over twice, and held very
long talks with Uncle Corny; but I had simply refused to
take part in them. To go into all the pros and cons, and hear
one say this, and the other say that; all assuming in the
calmest manner that they knew at least ten times as much
about my poor self, and my richer self, as both of us put
together knew, in our most conscientious moments—grateful as
I was, I offered them that view of gratitude, which alone can
make a slow shot at her fleeting speed—the instantaneous
process. In the twenty-four millionth part of a moment, all
her legs have spurned the wind, and the fool who thought to
chronicle her, finds her dust upon his glass.</p>

<p>Herein I was not just, or fair; and I have lived to be ashamed
of it. But up to this present time of search, I have not come
across the man, who continued to be just and fair, while a
wrong that went to the bottom of his soul was fresh, and hot,
and turbid. Such men there may be, of vast philosophy, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
profound religion; but I have never met them yet; and if I do,
I shall be afraid of them.</p>

<p>Thus I waited, day by day, slowly quitting hold of hope,
hardening myself to do without her, by incessant work of hand.
In this I took no pride or pleasure, as a mill finds none in perpetual
grind; but from morning twilight till evening dusk, I
laboured among the lonely trees. My uncle begged me to go
to London, if only for a little change and stir, as the strawberry
season came, and he began to use his stand again. But I felt
myself unfit for this, and knew that in my present vein, I
should only do a mischief to him, among his ancient customers.
For a happy face and a cheerful spirit do best among the buyers;
and a bit of chaff, or a turn of slang, will sometimes help a lame
market through. I knew a man once, a mere carter he was,
who had never been near “Common Garden” before, but was
sent up by a neighbouring grower, as a last resource, when his
salesman fell ill. A mere bumpkin he was, and he wore a
smock-frock, and cord trousers tied below the knee; but his
round, merry face, and broad country brogue, and native simplicity
and twinkling eyes, took the humour of the crowd;
and he sold out all his lot at top prices, by looking as
fresh as his fruit, before anybody else had got rid of a
dozen.</p>

<p>“Well, if you won’t go up, you won’t,” my uncle said to me
one day; “but you will break down, going on like this. I like
a young fellow to work; but I can’t abide for him to do nothing
else, and never think twice of his victuals. And you are spoiling
your own chance altogether, in another and a very important
affair. Your Aunt Parslow took a great fancy to you, and she
meant to come down handsome when she dies. She told me
that, almost in so many words. And now you are setting her
quite against you. You know how you behaved, the last time
she came over.”</p>

<p>“I could not endure her perpetual talk. You can’t say that
I was rude to her. But I don’t want her money. What good
is it to me? I wish she had never given us a farthing.”</p>

<p>“It is nasty rubbish to talk like that, Kit; and every one
will turn against you. You used to have such a lot of common
sense. Well, perhaps you were not exactly rude to her; or at
least you did not mean to be. But there is nothing ruder, as
women look at it, than to let them have all the talk to themselves;
although they insist upon it, if you don’t. You must
not interrupt them, of course; but still you must say enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
show that you are listening, and that you think highly of what
they are saying; though of course you knew it all, before they
began. Instead of that, what did you do? You crossed your legs;
women never like that, when they are talking to you, any more
than a lap-dog who wants to jump up. I don’t know why it
is; but they never can bear it. And you did worse than that.
The clock struck five, and you began to count it. You young
fellows never behave well to ladies.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I did not mean to offend her, uncle. I never
thought twice of what I was doing.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And you should have thought of nothing else,
while you seemed to think only of what she was saying. But I
want you to do me a favour, Kit. I suppose you don’t wish to
offend me too?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Because you are reasonable, and have
always been so good to me. I will do anything to oblige you,
Uncle Corny.”</p>

<p>“And by doing it, you will oblige yourself. You are wearing
your fingers to the bone, and all the flesh off your other
bones, by this confounded stubbornness. I hate to hear the tap
of your hammer almost, much as I used to like it. Now, just
take old Spanker to-morrow afternoon, and drive over to your
aunt’s at Leatherhead, with a basket of strawberries I promised
her. She doesn’t know what a good strawberry is; eleven
people out of a dozen don’t; any more than a babe that just opens
his mouth. She has plenty of her own, I know; but none worth
the trouble of eating. To-morrow will be Saturday. You can
stop till Monday; and it will do you a lot of good, and set you
up again almost. There is nothing like a woman in a case like
yours. You let her talk on, and you never contradict her, and
she says to herself—‘Well, I have done him good!’ And so
she has; not the way she meant it; but by making you think
that they are all alike, and not a bit of solid sense among them.
And it is not only that, but you are pleased to think how much
better you know things than they do; though you don’t say one
word to their fifty. Whenever I am bothered, or cheated, or
insulted, I get a nice woman to talk to me; and it is as good as
a pipe of the best birdseye; which you can have at the same
time, if you know how to do it.”</p>

<p>“You seem to look at things for your own advantage only,”
I answered, because I thought these views low; “however I
will do as you wish; and Sunday is a dreadful day for me here,
without any work. I thought last Sunday would never end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>;
and not being a woman, I could not come and comfort
you.”</p>

<p>I was pleased with this rap at him; because I could not
see what business he had with nice women, and so on; whether
they came to his house to talk with him, or whether he went
to have his pipe at theirs, as he had almost let out by his last
words. For there never was a woman who could stop him of
a pipe in his own house—that was certain. But that he should
talk of my being stubborn, amused me, every time I thought of
it. Verily if I had a splinter of that substance in me, he was
the oak from which it came; and he might have spared
enough to roof a church, without anybody asking how he was.</p>

<p>Now he wrote to my aunt that I was coming, according to
her proposal, and he made Tabby Tapscott come up to the
cottage, and pack up a few things for me, inasmuch as I had
no one now to do it. And he had his best strawberries picked
in the morning, before the sun margarined them, and kept in a
cold place till I was ready, and then packed so that no heat
could get at them. And as <i>Spanker</i> had not been to London
for three days, he was sure to strike out at a merry pace, when he
found himself free of the country. For I never saw a horse that
liked to go to London; any more than a man loves a cemetery.</p>

<p><i>Spanker</i> was as gay as May, as soon as he knew where he
was going; and he roused up each hill with a rush from the
other, which showed a deep sense of Mechanics. Nobody
would have believed his age, even if he had told it truly;
which he had strong human reason for not attempting, having
found his teeth filed quite early.</p>

<p>What with the brisk air of those hills, and the soft turn of
the valleys, and the gaiety of the time of year, a quantity of
heaviness went from me, and a vein of health flowed in. Not
that I ever said to myself—as people of inconstant nature do,—“There
are better fish in the sea,” etc.; or, “If she be not
fair to me;” or even so much as, “Care killed the cat.” My
mood was neither independent nor defiant, and I felt as
respectful towards women as ever. It was only that more hope
came inside me, from seeing so much in the world outside; and
perhaps more faith in the Lord, because He was doing His
best so largely. However, I never thought twice about that,
and must claim no credit for it.</p>

<p>Aunt Parslow was not very gracious at first, though she
could not find fault with the strawberries. She pretended that
she had some quite as good; though she declared herself to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
most grateful. But as soon as I said, “Send for some of your
own; that will be the true proof of the pudding, aunt,” she
discovered that her own were not quite at their best just
now, and in fact they had been so good, that the slugs and the
blackbirds could not resist them. This showed very little self-command
on their part; for there was not a good fruit among
them, as I found out on Sunday, the beds being a mixture of
some twenty kinds, growing in great tussocks, and for the most
part barren, which was just as well.</p>

<p>I let my aunt have her own way, as a man should let all
women do, except those of his own household; and by-and-by
she became more pleasant, especially when she had discovered—as
she did at dinner-time—that my present state of health
required a bottle of her dry champagne. Being compelled
myself, I thought it just to use coercion too, and had the
satisfaction soon of finding her much more ladylike. Her coldness
towards me passed away, and when we had clinked our
glasses twice, we resumed our proper footing.</p>

<p>“You don’t fill up,” she said more than once, and I found
the same fault with her; and when that error had been
removed, we could enter into one another’s feelings.</p>

<p>“The great thing you want is nourishment,” she said, when
I had made a noble dinner; “people in the present age never
attach sufficient importance to that point. They indulge too
much in stimulants—no more, Kit, no more, or at the outside,
only half fill your own, for you require it—while they scarcely
allow themselves time to take the proper amount of substance.
Through a very old and deeply respected friend of our family
in the City, a man of the loftiest principles, I am enabled to
get the real turtle at half-price; and it has been instrumental,
under Providence, in the restoration of your health. I have
sent him a telegram; and to-morrow, although it is the
Sabbath-day, we shall find a tin here, when we return from
church. It is better than Grove’s, or any that you see in the
windows going down Cheapside. A turtle should never be
allowed to sprawl about barbarously in the sun. It is against his
nature, and it does him harm. He becomes demoralized, and
looses firmness. They say that we all spring from turtles
now; but I cannot believe it; for cannibalism is never nice,
and turtle is. What a turtle your Uncle Cornelius would have
made!”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you find him so nice,” I replied; “but he
would always have tasted of tobacco.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we must allow for one another; and there is no
accounting for tastes. <i>Jupiter</i> likes turtle; but the other dogs
won’t touch it. I had a dog once who would eat cigars. If he
found a stump in the road, it was quite as good as a bone to
him; but he did not live very long, poor fellow! Now let them
take away the things; and when you have had your glass of
port, come to me in the drawing-room. Don’t hurry, because I
mean to have my nap.”</p>

<p>As yet, she had never mentioned Kitty’s name, which surprised
me not a little; but I thought it likely that she was still
rather sore at my behaviour. For when she had come to see us
lately, it had been more than I could bear to listen calmly while
everybody offered any sort of guess; just as they might discuss
a case of abduction in the papers, or the theft of a female dog,
who “answered to the name of Kitty.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.<br />

<small>TRUE COMFORT.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Every</span> allowance should be made for a man who is in deep
trouble. Not because it is his due, for that would count but
little; but because he expects it, which he never does of his
other debts, after experience. But he does hope to receive fine
feeling, when he knows how cheap it is; and his sense of bad
luck blackens in him, when he cannot even get that much.</p>

<p>And yet he ought to feel how trumpery are his trivial joys
and sorrows, in the whirligig of this great world. He does his
utmost thus to take it; to shudder at the wrongs of others, and
to glow at their redress, to suck his fingers more and more with
the relish of his neighbour’s pie; and perhaps with practice he
begins to get some moonlight pleasure thus. But, alas! before
he is perfect in it, some little turn of thought comes home,
some soft remembrance thrills his heart, as the sun quivers in
a well-spring, and all his nature lets him know that he belongs
to it, and is itself.</p>

<p>A little touch of this kind took me, when I was full of
higher things, or at least was trying so to be. I had not been
to church since my day of dole, my day of doom and desolation.
How could I go to Sunbury church, and see the spot where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Kitty stood and stole my whole devotion, and see the altar-rails
where she had knelt and vowed herself mine for ever; and now,
with no Kitty at my side, be stared at by a hundred eyes, all
asking—“Well, how do you get on?” But now in this strange
place, I went to the Sunday morning service, though Kitty had
been there too with me, in the happy days not long gone by.
My aunt came with me, and with much fine feeling allowed
me to sit where my dear had sat, and to put my hat on the
selfsame peg on which she had placed it for me.</p>

<p>At first it was a bitter time; but I went through it bravely,
though at first I could not bring myself to open the Prayer-book,
which I had brought in the bag with my clothes from
Sunbury. My wife had given it to me at Baycliff, when I
happened to admire it in a window, and I remembered that she
had written “Kit,” and nothing else, on the fly-leaf.</p>

<p>But the first psalm for that morning service, being a very
sad one, suited my state of mind so well that I opened my book
to follow it. And I remember reading with all my heart—“My
heart is smitten down, and withered like grass; so that I forget
to eat my bread. I am become like a pelican in the wilderness;
and like an owl that is in the desert.”</p>

<p>Perhaps through the shaking of my thumb, the cover of
the book fell back, and showed me some words on the fly-leaf
written with a pencil by my own wife. Before the word
“Kit,” which was in ink, she had written with a pencil
“Darling,” and after it, “God’s will be done.” The writing
was faint, as if the pencil wanted cutting, and it seemed to
have been dashed off in great haste.</p>

<p>This then was her farewell to me. I was sure that the
words had not been there, the last time I used the Prayer-book;
and indeed there would have been no meaning in them.
Over and over again I read them, forgetting everything else, I
fear, and standing up after the first lesson had begun, until my
aunt gave my coat a jerk. I longed to rush out of the church
and think; and the rest of the service went by me, as a dream.</p>

<p>Though very little light was thrown hereby upon my dark
enigma, I found more comfort perhaps than reason would
warrant, in this discovery. In the first place, if my wife had
left me, in bitterness at some fancied wrong, she would never
have addressed me thus; and this alone removed a weight of
misery from my bosom. For it had been agony to me to
think, as I could not help doing, that my own Kitty all the
while was nursing bitterness against me, as if it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
possible for me to wrong her. And again that she should not
have gone entirely without a word, was a piece of real comfort
to me; though others, who have not been so placed, may think
that I was foolish there. Very likely I was; but never mind.
The Prayer-book, as we all acknowledge, is a very noble work;
and nobody can write such English now, as is to be found in it
at every page; and I think that Kitty was quite right in
choosing it for her last word to me. But if it comes to that,
she was always right; at least according to my ideas.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem to some—who cannot enter into
odd states of mind, such as long had been my lot—I did not
say a word, as yet, to my Aunt Parslow about this matter. She
had formed her own theory, like everybody else, and I meant
to let her go through with it. And so she did, that afternoon,
having put great pressure upon herself—for my sake, as she
told me—to enable her to hold her tongue, until she could
speak with advantage, and without any risk of being taken by
any one for a meddler.</p>

<p>For she liked to dine early on Sundays, and she always
denied herself the pleasure of going to church in the afternoon,
being one of the most unselfish persons I have ever met with.
After a dinner not to be gainsaid, at any rate till supper-time,
we sat in the garden and listened to the bells, and thought with
pleasure of the congregation now going to have a hot time of
it. I was full of tender recollections, for this was the very
spot where Kitty had shown some delightful want of reason
about Sally Chalker. And I told my aunt all about it now,
with a sigh at the back of every smile. Then she laughed with
superior wisdom, and no longer could contain herself.</p>

<p>“I knew she was a jealous little puss. Every woman has
her fault, almost as much as men have. It took me a long
time to discover any fault in her, until I started that idea myself.
To make up for the want of other faults, she has that
one to an extreme, you see. And that is at the bottom of your
present trouble, my poor boy. But she has carried it to an
extreme, I admit. It seems a little too absurd.”</p>

<p>“It is too absurd to be thought of twice,” I answered
rather savagely; “my Kitty is not quite a fool. And she
would have been something worse than a fool, if she had acted
from that motive. She would have been unjust and cruel, not
to afford me so much as a chance of clearing myself from wicked
lies. Our married life was short indeed; but long enough for
her to learn that I am not a scoundrel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be so hot, Kit. You have no idea what a woman’s
mind is. She thought you, of course, a perfect angel, and
herself not good enough to wipe your shoes. She was always
humble, as you know; and that tyrant of a woman must have
beaten into her poor head a bitter sense of her own defects. It
is only natural, she would think, that this great wonder of a
man should want some one better than poor me. And when
some villain laid before her some strong evidence, we know
not what, she would say to herself—‘It is as I thought. I
will not trouble him to explain. I will leave him for a while,
and perhaps his love will return, when he has lost me. With
this in my heart, I could not bear to look at him, and know all
the while he was longing to be rid of me. I will have no
scene, which would only make him think even less of me than
he does.’ And so she would go, without caring where.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, aunt, some women might have done so. But
not Kitty. She felt to her heart my affection for her; and
she trusted me, as I trusted her. Do you suppose that if what
you say had even seemed possible to me, I should have remained,
as I have done, waiting for some news of her. I
should have rushed up to every one, who had any motive for
deceiving her, and taken them by the throat, and wrung their
wicked, murderous lies out. No, it is something much worse than
that. If Kitty had left me in petulance, would she have
written these last words, would she have called me her
‘darling Kit’? See what I found this morning.”</p>

<p>“That proves nothing,” resumed my aunt, when I had
shown her my Prayer-book, and we had discussed that matter;
“she may very well have relented, at the last moment, and
written that to you.”</p>

<p>“Then would she have taken all our money? Was that
the way to cure my jealousy, and bring me back to her in
penitence? She had a right to the money, because you put it
into her own hand. But I am astonished at her taking it.”</p>

<p>Miss Parslow was even more astonished, when I told her
that part of the tale, which I had begged Uncle Corny not to
do. It grieved me that she should ever hear of it; but she
certainly had the right to know.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you told her in so many words that you meant it
entirely for herself,” I suggested, hoping that it might be so;
for, little as I cared for that trumpery loss, I was cut to the
quick that my wife should have inflicted it; “Kitty must
have believed it her own, or she never would have touched it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“I said nothing of the kind,” my aunt replied indignantly;
“I gave it to her, but I meant it for you—that is to say conjointly.
Her taking it was robbery, and nothing else.”</p>

<p>I laughed a little at these words, which I had heard from
other quarters. That my Kitty should be called a robber,
seemed a little too absurd. But I could not be angry in the
teeth of facts, at any rate with the donor.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is,” she said, even as I had been told
before; “either your wife is as deep a little hypocrite as ever
lived, which I cannot believe, for I should never trust any one
again if I did; or else she ran away from you in a moment of
insanity. My poor boy, I am so sorry for you. I cannot bear
to ask you, but have you ever noticed any tendency that way—anything
even odd, or absent, or inconsequential in her
manner? The professor is a very queer man, I have heard.
All great men of science are—well, to say the least eccentric.”</p>

<p>“Captain Fairthorn is perfectly sound and clear-headed,
though not a good man of business. And his daughter is as
rational as I am—much more so, if I am to endure much more
of this. She is quick, and bright-witted, and full of common
sense; except that, like her father, she is a little too confiding.
I never saw a token of even the slightest absence of mind about
her. Her only insanity was that she loved me a great deal
better than she loved herself. I believe she would have laid
down her life with pleasure—”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about it, my dear Kit. I think you have
borne things wonderfully well, now that I know all you have
told me. And you must not break down now, my dear. All
will come right in the end, be sure, although we are in thick
darkness now. In spite of all difficulties, I still hold to my
idea of jealousy. However, we won’t talk of that any more.
You know that I called upon Miss Coldpepper, the last time I
was at Sunbury?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I never heard what she said. I cannot see
how she could help us at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought it worth while to try; and I found her
much kinder than I expected. A little bit stiff at first perhaps,
and rather of the grand lady style; but I am sure that she
would help you, if she could. She likes Kitty better than her
own nieces; that I am quite sure of; and she does not side a bit
with that horrid Mrs. Fairthorn, at least as everybody makes her
out, though I always form my own opinion. She perceived, of
course, that I was a lady, and not to be treated as a fruit-grower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
might be, such as everybody looks upon as a sort of
apple-pie. I explained that my connection with your Uncle
Orchardson was casual, and had been against my wishes; while
my family had been in the China-trade; and she asked very
kindly, if I would have a cup of tea. I accepted, because I
knew how it makes ladies talk. Then she asked me what I
thought of it, and I said it was poor stuff; for I had no idea
of being patronized by her, and I saw that she had sense
enough to like the truth, especially when it was to her advantage,
although not very complimentary. Then she asked me
where she could get a better article; and I told her that I
never recommended any place, having nothing to do with any
business now, but living in a very pretty place of my own.
Naturally this made her press me more; and not liking to be
disagreeable, I told her of a place, where by taking twelve
pounds she could get a tea worth two of hers, for fifteen pence
a pound less money. And this made a very fine impression
upon her; for she loves good value for her money. Then she
became very gracious indeed; especially after her cur of a dog
came in, and smelling souvenirs of my high breed, did his
utmost to improve himself, by licking them. For your sake,
Kit, I was obliged to say, that the wretched mongrel looked
well-bred. Oh dear, oh dear!”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind, aunt; he has done me a good turn—”
I remembered in time to stop sharply. My Aunt Parslow
would take it as worse than high treason, that I should have
stolen even such a dog; and how could I call it a good turn
now?</p>

<p>“No dog would do you a bad turn, Kit,” she continued
quite serenely; “at any rate no well-bred dog; they are as
good as a woman, and infinitely better than any man, in judging
human character. Now listen to what I have to say. I
am not very sharp, for I live out of the world; and everybody
owns that it gets much worse, from year to year, and from day
to day. But I don’t care twopence for that, my dear, because
nothing I can do will alter it. Only I am as sure as I am of
the nature of the very best dog I ever had—and there he lies,
beneath that tree—that your Kitty has never done a thing to
wrong you, at least according to her view of things. I will not
attempt to explain that money matter; for it is beyond me,
and I am sorry that I spoke so harshly. I should have considered
your feelings more, for I know that you are as true as
steel. There is some black secret that we cannot pierce; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
will all become clear as the day, in time; and in time, I hope,
for your happiness. I can well understand that you have
been stopped in all your inquiries, by that strange device—for
I believe it to be but another device, on the part of some very
crafty foe. You have let some weeks go by, through that.
No good has ever come, so far as I know, of any of those
‘Private Inquiry’ places; and I hate the very name of them.
But I think that you are bound to watch the proceedings of
those two villains, who carried off your Kitty, to that vile place
near Hounslow. Of course, they would never take her there
again. That you have ascertained long ago. And I do not
believe that they have got her now. She would be no good to
them, as a married woman. But they know where she is. I
am sure of that. You have been in a maze of dejection and
distress. And your pride has prevented you from doing what
you should have done. Go and see those two men. Hunt
them out. Take the matter entirely into your own hands.
Your Uncle Cornelius is very good and kind. But it is not
his wife who is missing.”</p>

<p>“Those two men are not in London. That much has been
ascertained,” I said; “and it does not appear that they were in
London, at the time—at the time of my trouble.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Find out where they are. Follow them;
never mind where it is. As for money, you shall have another
hundred pounds, and a thousand if it proves needful. Don’t
thank me, Kit. It is for my own peace. I have not enjoyed
seeing a dog eat his dinner, since this wickedness was done.
You shall thank me as much as ever you like, when you have
got your Kitty back again. And she will love you ten times
more than ever.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.<br />

<small>BEHIND THE FIDDLE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is vain for any man to say that, in the deepest depths of
woe, he can receive no scrap of comfort from the tenderness of
others. Words may help him very little; commonplace exhortations
are a weariness to the worn-out soul; he lies at the
bottom of his own distress, and does not want it probed or
touched. But gradually a little light and warmth steal through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the darkness, not direct from heaven alone, but reflected from
kind eyes and hearts. He is not alone in the world, although
he ever must be lonely; and the sense of other life than his
restores him slowly to his own.</p>

<p>After all the kindness shown me, and the good-will wholly
undeserved, I felt ashamed to be so swallowed up by my own
sorrow. Some indulgence I might claim from people of kindly
nature, on the ground that it was not sorrow only, but dark
mystery and doubt, and even some sense of black disgrace,
which had robbed me of my proper vigour and due power of
manhood. And it is more than likely that the long and wasting
illness, from which I had not yet quite recovered, still impaired
the force and tone of mind as well as body. But I do not want
to make excuses, as people nearly always say in the very breath
they make them with. Only I was now resolved that no more
should be needed.</p>

<p>On the Monday, I drove <i>Spanker</i> home; which was a great
delight to him, and to me as well, for the world looked brighter,
when my face was set to fight it. Or rather I should say, to
fight that vile and wicked part of it, which had robbed me of
my just claim to a happy though humble place in it. In my
breast-pocket I carried the book containing my wife’s last words
to me; for my good Aunt Parslow had kindly stitched it in a
white kid glove, or a pair of them, which had been white in
their early days. And in the pocket on the other side, I carried
fifty pounds in bank-notes, so as to be able to start well,
and procure better judgment than my own, if it should appear
advisable. But about that I was not sure as yet; being very
loth to ask any other man’s opinion, however old he might be,
about my pretty Kitty.</p>

<p>It was now the longest day, which is the most excellent and
perfect time of year, in at least three years out of every four.
Sometimes there arises a strong hot June; but scarcely more
than once in twenty summers; and then, before the days come
to their turn, leaves are getting flabby, and the grass is over-ripe,
and the petals of the wild rose lie in the ditch, and the
blossom of the wheat has dropped, its little quivery bee’s-wing.
More often there has been a black Pentecost, a May of lowering
skies and blight, with every animal’s coat put the wrong way
on his back; and then a June of shrink and shiver, without a
fair flower in the garden, and with the hedgerows full of black
caterpillars. And every man flaps himself with his arms, like
a cock when he springs up to crow; but the hedger and ditcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
has nothing to crow at, and is too hoarse to do it, if he
had.</p>

<p>But now we had a very fair midsummer, neither too hot nor
too cold; and the air was not only fresh but soft, and full of sweet
yet invigorating smells. At the top of every hill, one seemed
to sniff the rich calm of the valley, and again in the valley to feel
the crisp air of the hill coming down for a change of mood;
there was nothing to make much fuss about in the way of
striking scenery; but a pretty peep could be had at almost
every turn of travelling, where green leaves softened the brilliant
sky, and sheep and cattle, in quiet pastures, showed that they
accepted life, as if it were a blessing.</p>

<p>But I found my uncle regarding life from a very different point
of view. He had brought all his strawberry-pickers in at three
o’clock that morning, to make the great hit of the summer, as
he hoped, in the Monday forenoon market. At six a.m. he had
sent off about five hundredweight of prime fruit, all in pound
punnets with dewy leaves, as fresh as the daybreak, and as
bright as the sun, before it leaves off blushing. But ere he
could put one upon his stand, one hundred and twenty tons of
French stuff, which had been discharged the night before, were
running, like a flood from some horse-knacker’s, in every alley
of the market. This refuse was offered, by the bucketful, at
a penny a pound, which was too much for it; a dumpy, and
flabby, and slimy mass, fit for children to make dirt pies of.
Of course the good buyers would not look at it, for no man
could put it in his window. But the British public could put
it in their stomachs, which is not at all a choice receptacle;
and the mere fact of its presence took the shine out of all
fair English fruit. Uncle Corny’s choice <i>Presidents</i>, and <i>Dr.
Hoggs</i>, as good as if they leaped from stalk to lip, became jam
for the Juggernauth of free trade; and he was left lamenting,
as well as swearing very hard.</p>

<p>Whenever he had used strong language,—however well justified
by international law—he was apt to show less of true
penitence, than of anger with the world that had made him do
it. Being a righteous man, he always felt ashamed; but he
never was known to retract an expression; though he often
declared that his words had been too weak, and he wished he
had said what he was charged with saying. But Selsey Bill
told me that he had been “just awful,” and they were expecting
beer all round, as a token of remorse. “Said a’ would
sack every son of a gun of us! Never knowed ’un say that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
wi’out sending can out by-and-by. Ah, he is a just man,
Master Kit, if ever was one.”</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Kit,” said my uncle, who was getting,
with the aid of a pipe, into his right mind. “You are looking
ever so much better, my boy. Can’t return the compliment, I
fear. The fact is, I have been a little put out; though I never
lost my temper, as most people would have done. Fearful
smash this morning at the Garden. But all the poor fellows
did their very best, and it would not be fair to punish them.
They’ve been hard at it, ever since three o’clock. You might
take the four-gallon can, if you like, just to show them that
you are come home again. And I daresay you’ll be glad of a
glass yourself, for the roads are getting dusty. You can come
and talk to me, when you’ve been round. Only half a pint
each for the women, mind. It would never do to get them into
bad habits. Unless any of them has a baby.”</p>

<p>When I had discharged that little duty, I told him of all that
my aunt had said, and showed him the message to me in the
book, if indeed it could be called a message. He shook his head
very wisely over this, and told me that he must think about
it; for he could not at present see the meaning of it. But I
saw that it altered his opinion of the case.</p>

<p>“You have been up to the cottage already, I see,” he continued,
as I sat quietly, after vainly searching once more the
columns of his paper the <i>Standard</i>, as I daily did; “you will
never find any notice there, my boy, nor in any other paper.
It is the blackest puzzle I ever came across; and this only
makes it the blacker. Mother Bull is come back”—he should
have said, “the Honourable Mrs. Bulwrag Fairthorn”—“I was
told so yesterday by that good woman, who came down when
you were so ill. You know the woman I mean—Mrs. Wilcox.
She was down here yesterday to ask for you, and was very
sorry not to find you. She said that if Mother Bull had not
been away, she could have sworn that it was all her doing.
But now she doubts whether she knew anything about it; for
when she does a thing, she always does it by herself, and
never trusts any one with her wicked works. Mrs. Wilcox has
not heard a word from your wife, as I need not tell you; but
she flies in a fury at the smallest hint that there can be any
fault on her part. She says that poor Kitty could never plot
anything, even if she wished it. Her mind is too simple, and
she could never carry out any plan requiring sharp management.
I asked her what she thought of it all, and she could think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
nothing at all worth speaking of. Only that there is something
we don’t know—which I could have told her, without
walking a mile. But I think it might do you good to go and
see her; and it would comfort you at any rate, for she holds all
your own opinions. And she said one thing which I thought
right, and sharper of her than I expected, for it never had
occurred to me—that you should take in one of those scientific
journals, which give an account of discoveries and all that; so
as to find out, if you can, where Professor Fairthorn is.”</p>

<p>“How can that do any good.” I asked. “He had
sailed at least ten days before I was forsaken, and while we
were down at Baycliff. The telegram from Falmouth proved
all that.”</p>

<p>“That is clear enough. And of course he cannot help us,
while he is far away at sea. But for all that, we are bound to
let him know, if there should be any chance. You would write
to him, or write at him, if his daughter was dead; and it is
very much the same case now.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Corny, you have the most coldblooded way sometimes,
though you never mean it. Certainly I am bound to let
him know, if I can; and I ought to have thought of it before.
But he has given us little of his company. I will go and see
Mrs. Wilcox to-morrow, if only to find out what paper to get;
for she will know what they used to take in. And I shall find
out what is going on up there; though I don’t see how it will
help me much.”</p>

<p>“When that dog was stolen from Miss Coldpepper,” said
my uncle, without meaning any harm, “by some big rogue in
London, what did she do? Why, she offered a reward at once,
and sent posters right and left. And what was the result?
Why, the dog came back almost before she had time to miss
him.”</p>

<p>“But if he came back without any reward, what could the
reward have to do with it?”</p>

<p>“How do you know that no reward was paid?” My uncle
seemed quite to look suspicious; but perhaps it was my conscience
that made him do it. “We can’t tell what happened
between them, up there.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” I replied with haste; “but I don’t like
talking about a dog, in the same breath with my Kitty.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean to annoy you, Kit,” he answered very
humbly; “although the poor lady may have felt it bitterly, in
her little way. All that I meant was, that we might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
offered a large reward for any information. It could have done
no harm, you know. And it might have come to Kitty’s ears,
and inclined her to come back to us. Women are so glad to
save expense.”</p>

<p>“How can you understand such things? As if I could bear
to fetch my wife home, by jingling a purse before the world!
If she won’t come back without that, she had better—she had
better almost stay away.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I can understand your feelings; and very
likely I should have the same. You are like me, Kit, in many
things; although a deal more obstinate.”</p>

<p>My uncle was fond of saying this; but it always took my
breath away, from the sublimity of his self-ignorance. It
was like an oak-tree bidding an osier not to be so gnarled and
stiff.</p>

<p>“Now remember one thing,” he went on, as he saw me
smiling just a little; “in spite of your stubbornness, you shall
obey me, or I will know the reason why. You have tried what
good hard work would do, and it has done you more harm than
good. Because your mind has not been in it, and you have
only been fretting at every stroke, though you stuck to it, like
a Briton. To-day you are twice the man, because you have
had a little change, and seen a little of a different life, and
allowed yourself to speak more freely of your sad affairs, instead
of snapping at every one who mentioned them. Henceforth
you shall never do more than eight hours’ work in these gardens
in one day, I mean of course all by yourself. For sixteen
hours every day, you have avoided every one, and carried on
work, work, all alone, as if you never meant to speak again.
I am pretty tough; but it would have killed me, although I
am no chatterbox. And it has gone some way towards killing
you. I left you to your own foolish plan, because of your
confounded obstinacy. But now, I will try to be as stubborn
myself. I will come after you, with my supple-jack, unless
you give me your word on this. And another thing you must
bear in mind. You have taken your good aunt’s money for a
particular purpose; and you will have had it on false pretences,
if you go on thus.”</p>

<p>“I intend to use it for what she meant. I would never
have taken it otherwise. You shall not complain of my
sticking too close, but rather of my absence. But I shall not
draw my weekly money from you, unless I have done a good
week’s work. To-morrow I shall do very little, because I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
going to London. To-night I shall work for an hour or two,
because I have a job to finish. And I will look in, when you
are having your last pipe.”</p>

<p>There was every promise of a fruitful season, though not
without plenty to grumble at, for I never knew a season good
all round, such as more favoured countries have. After getting
myself into working trim, I left my lonely little dwelling, with
the front door so arranged that any one who knew the trick
could enter without knocking. And in the kitchen fireplace—for
I never used the parlour now—I left a little coke alight, so
that it would smoulder on for hours, and could soon, with the
aid of wood and coal, be nursed into glow enough to boil the
kettle, which stood ready upon the hob. For I always fancied,
when I went to work, that I might find my wife, when I should
come home, making it a home for me once more, and listening
to the singing of the kettle. And I left the lane door unfastened
too, that she might have no trouble to get in.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, I seemed to feel that something strange
would befall me that night, but I went about my work as
usual. I had a large peach-tree to go over, for the second time
that season, fetching every shoot into place, checking or sometimes
cutting out the over-coarse and sappy growth, nipping
every blistered leaf, removing the fruit, where it grew too
thick or had no chance of swelling, and offering the many
other small attentions, without which fine fruit may not be.
And outside the border on the gravel walk I had the garden
engine full of water for the nightly bath, which fruit and
foliage in warm weather love, as much as vermin hate it.</p>

<p>The sun had been down for an hour or more, and the dusk
was deepening into night, and I was just at the point of leaving
off for fear of hammering the wrong sort of nail—when I heard
a little sound, like the scraping of a twig, and turning my head,
without any great hurry, beheld, as distinctly as I see this paper,
the face of a man looking steadfastly at me. It was a large and
solid face, as calm and unmoved as the full moon appears rising
out of the haze on a fine summer night.</p>

<p>I could see no hat above the face, nor any human figure
below it, only a face looking through a gap in a clipped <i>arbor
vitæ</i> tree, about fifteen yards from where I stood. It was
gazing at me quite serenely, and as if I were hardly worth the
trouble.</p>

<p>Through all the time of my long distress, I had wholly lost
the sense of fear—bodily fear I mean, and nervous trembling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
such as brave men have. This had surprised me more than
once; things that used to make me jump had not the least
effect on me. The reason was simply that my life was not of
the smallest value to me. And I wondered that I was not
frightened now, because I knew that I ought to be.</p>

<p>Without even taking my hammer up, I leaped across the
border, to seize this fellow; but my foot caught in something,
and down I went. A heavy garden-line had been left,
stretched along by one of our men, who had been “making up
the edge” that day. I knew it was there, but had not thought
of it in my hurry; and now I was lame in both knees for a
minute, for the shock had been very violent. At first I thought
that my left leg was broken; but after a bit of rubbing it got
better, and I hobbled towards the <i>Thuja</i> tree, which had been
clipped into the shape of a fiddle by Bill Tompkins.</p>

<p>I dragged myself round it; but saw no one, nor even a footprint
in the waning of the light; neither was there any sound
among the trees beyond it. Wondering greatly, and very angry
with the fellow who had left the line there, I collected my tools
with some difficulty, and was obliged to leave the tree
unsyringed. Then, as I went stiffly home, I thought of the fuss
my Kitty would have made, to see me in that bleeding hobble;
and if I was weak in body through it, I fear that I was weaker
still in mind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.<br />

<small>THE GREAT LADY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> this time, I slept, or lay down to sleep, on a couple of
good-sized chairs in the kitchen, with a cushion laid along
them, which had come from my uncle’s pew in Sunbury church.
He had established a new cushion there, on the strength of
my marriage and Kitty’s good clothes; and the old one, being
stuffed with sound horsehair, was not to be despised when
upside down. And to save all risk of rolling off, I set it
against the front legs of the dresser. The door of the room
was left wide open, and the front door also, unless the night
was windy; for I had nothing to lose, having lost my all;
and I only wished that anybody would come and try to rob me.
It would have been bad for him, unless he had been either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Hercules, of Ulysses; for I was armed with recklessness, and
eager to tackle any open foe. Nervousness (such as a happy
man may feel, when he hears a strange noise in the dead of the
night) was an unknown power to me now, and I would have
fought, like a bull-dog in his own kennel, and enjoyed it. This
was not the proper turn of mind for a young man to indulge in.
That I knew as well as could he; but the blame lay elsewhere.</p>

<p>Although I was very stiff and sore from the bruises of that
awkward fall, I went at daylight to examine the place, where
that stranger must have stood. The ground was dry and hard
just there; but I found enough to show me that I had not been
deceived by any trick of the imagination. Not only had the
soil been trodden by a foot unlike my own, but the thick mat of
the <i>Thuja</i> tree had some of the lobed leaves (which composed it
and stood together like moss compressed), ruffled and crushed
into one another, as if by the thrust of a heavy form. Then I
went to the place where I had stood over against the peach-tree,
and put my hat on a nail to represent my height, and returning
to the clipped tree gazed through the nick of the fiddle at it,
just as the face had gazed at me. I was obliged to stoop, to
bring my eyes to the level at which those eyes had been; which
showed that my visitor had been of some three or four inches
lower stature, probably not more than five feet ten.</p>

<p>I could not trace his footsteps far, nor make out what kind
of boots he wore, except that there was no sign of hob-nails,
such as all our workmen had. It struck me that a man with
such a face was not very likely to hurry himself, and the ground
bore no traces of hasty flight, neither were the branches of the
plum-trees (through which he must have retreated) broken. Probably
he had retired at his leisure, while I was disabled from following.
There were no signs of entrance to be discovered at or
near the door into Love Lane; all our men had left work at
the time of his visit, and no one had seen any stranger.</p>

<p>What on earth had he come for? was the question which
arose, and could not be answered. There was nothing much
to steal just there, for none of the tree-fruit was ripe; and
though darkness forbade entire certainty, I felt pretty sure that
the owner of that face would call himself a gentleman. It
seemed to me better upon the whole to say nothing about the
matter, for my uncle would probably laugh at it, as the product
of my imagination; and as for the police, I knew too well that
they would make nothing out of it. Only it was evident to my
mind that this little adventure had some bearing on my trouble;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and in spite of the dusk, I could swear to that face, wherever I
should come across it.</p>

<p>My uncle would have stopped me from going to London, on account
of the injuries which I could not hide, for my hands as well
as my knees were cut. But I went by the ’bus, being very lame
as yet, and unable to walk without aid of a stick. Mrs. Wilcox
received me very kindly, and I was glad to find her business
thriving, and the sharp boy released from the pots, and growing
very useful at the counter.</p>

<p>“It has done him a deal of good, indeed it has, Mr. Kit,”
she said, when I ventured to hint that his employment had not
been elevating; “he knows every soul it is safe to give tick to;
and as for bad shillings, of which I had a dozen, not one have
we took since he come back. Ah, what a tradesman he will
make! But now, sir, about your poor dear self. No one to
stitch your knees better than that—ah, the righteous is always
punished in this earth.”</p>

<p>I told her exactly how things stood—that everything was as
dark as ever, that the neighbourhood had been searched in vain
(as might have been expected), that one or two false clues had
been followed, not by myself, but by the police, and that now I
meant to take the matter entirely into my own hands, as I should
have done at first except for a private reason, which I told her, to
wit the disappearance of the money. She was angry that this
should have been allowed to hinder me even for a day. But
when I told her how it weighed upon my spirits, and seemed to
show that my wife was not at all in her duty to me, Mrs. Wilcox
sided with me, and said that every one must do the same,
whether I were right in the end or wrong. And then I asked
her what she thought; and she said that she was afraid to say.</p>

<p>“Not that I don’t know her, sir,” she proceeded when she
saw my disappointment; “as well as the inside of my own
shoe, having had her almost from the bottle, and cut the best of
her teeth on my own thumb. But they changes so, when they
falls in love, as I know from my own experience, though going
on then for thirty-five, that to make a prediction comes back
on the mouth. I began it already; but it turned out wrong;
and I said to myself—‘If you want to be considered above the
average, as you always was, you better wait, and see how the cat
jumps first.’ For that is the way of the women, sir, in general.”</p>

<p>I was not in the mood to be satisfied with this, especially
as she had said the same thing to my uncle, as late as last
Sunday. And gradually, by coaxing her to begin, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
contradicting her upon some little point of fact, I knew her
opinions even better than my own, for my own had less to go
upon. For it must be borne in mind that most of what I have
entered about Sir Cumberleigh Hotchpot and Mr. Donovan
Bulwrag comes from knowledge which I obtained long afterwards;
and none of it was, in my mind as yet, beyond what
my Uncle Corny and Sam Henderson had said, and the little
that had been dropped by Kitty, who had scarcely had three
weeks as yet to talk.</p>

<p>“Well, I shall do this,” I said at last to Mrs. Wilcox;
“you have told me many things which will enable me to get
on. Nothing can be worse than things are now; and the
greatest enemy I have got—if I am good enough to have an
enemy—cannot say that I have shown impatience. I have felt
enough of it; but nobody knows but myself how close I have
kept it. I mean to make no disturbance now; but I shall just
go and see the great lady.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not, sir,” cried Mrs. Wilcox; “you would
be like a dummy, if she chose to speak out, and the humour
might be on her. And you can’t get nothing out of her, except
hard knocks.”</p>

<p>“Hard words break no bones, any more than soft ones
butter parsnips. I shall go and see her, if I can, and that
villain of a son of hers as well. It is my duty to discover
where my Kitty’s father is.”</p>

<p>“She won’t see you, Mr. Kit, unless it is to triumph over
you. She loves doing that, when any one is down. But you
won’t have a chance of seeing Mr. Downy. They say he is
out of the country altogether, though my little Teddy swears
he saw him Sunday night, and I never knew him go wrong
about a face before. But he must be wrong this time, if there
is any truth in words. And generally always he comes down
this road, whenever he is at home.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, I shall ask for him. By-the-bye, what is he
like, if I should chance to meet him?”</p>

<p>“He have a great square face, sir, like the front of a big
head, with a lot of sandy hair both above it and below. And
he comes along the road with his eyes half-shut, just as if there
was nothing worth looking at. And his eyes are as yellow as new-run
honey, and a few butter-spots upon his cheeks, where you
can see them. He is a square-built young man, not so tall as
you, but thicker, and his legs come after him as he walks, and
he looks as if he never could be in a hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you. I think I ought to know him now. It will
be my own fault if I don’t. Not a pleasant man to look at, if
you do him justice, Mrs. Wilcox. No wonder that people
don’t seem to like him very much.”</p>

<p>“Ever so much worse to deal with than he is to look at,
Mr. Kit. Keep out of his way, sir, that’s my advice. I
believe he is at the bottom of your trouble somehow. Though
what good he can get out of it surpasses me.”</p>

<p>After begging her to keep a sharp look-out, and to send for
me at once if she saw anything suspicious, I made the best of
my way towards “Bulwrag Park,” and was amazed at the
change a few months had wrought. All the wilderness of
work stood thick with houses, all the sloughs of despond were
firm hard roads, young trees were in leaf where surveyor’s flags
had waved, and public-houses blazed with glass and gilt where
bricks had smouldered. The Great Exhibition was in full
swing, and the long streets were alive with cabs and broughams.
However, the old house still looked grim and gaunt in its dark
retirement, and the Scotch firs near it were as black as ever;
and I passed with a throbbing heart the bay-tree which had
sheltered my love and myself from the snow. I ventured to
gather a spray of this, and put it as a keepsake beside my
Prayer-book.</p>

<p>After two or three rings, I was admitted, and shown into
the place I knew so well, and it seemed to my fancy to be
glistening still with the tearful eyes of my darling. Then Miss
Geraldine, the younger and more gentle of the daughters, came
and looked at me with some surprise, and said that she would
show me where her mother was, and I followed her into a
morning room.</p>

<p>The great lady looked as well as ever, and received me with
a stateliness which reminded me of her sister. She was beautifully
dressed, so far as I could judge, and seemed in high good
humour, and inclined to patronize me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Orchardson, I think you said, my dear? Mr. Orchardson,
who married our poor Kitty. Well, Mr. Orchardson, I
hope that you are happy. But surely—surely she did not do
this? And if she did, you must not appeal to us. Sometimes
she forgot herself—but still—and quite in the honeymoon—no,
I am sure it cannot be.”</p>

<p>I was determined not to be provoked, although it was very
hard upon me. This violent woman was pretending to believe
that the scratches on my face, from last night’s fall, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
inflicted by my dear wife’s nails. I did not condescend to
answer that; and I was certain that she knew I had no
Kitty now.</p>

<p>“I have ventured to intrude upon you,” I said, “upon a
matter of important business, madam. To ask if you will
kindly tell me how I can send a letter, so as to reach Captain
Fairthorn. He is at sea, I know, upon a voyage of exploration,
or something like that; and it may be very difficult to
communicate with him. But I have a very important
message—”</p>

<p>“Nothing amiss with your poor wife, I hope. Oh, I should
be so grieved, if there were anything of that sort. She was
flighty and wild; but with all her faults, there was much that
was good about her. You could never see it, Geraldine, as I
did. Please don’t tell me, Mr. Orchardson, that after all your
goodness to her—for few would have married her knowing
what she was—she has had the heart to deceive you.”</p>

<p>“No, she has never deceived me, madam; there is no
deceit in her nature. But—but for some good reason doubtless,—for
the present she has left me.”</p>

<p>No one can tell what it cost me to drag out these words to
her arch enemy, who was taking them in, like a draught of
nectar, not only for the fact—which she had known when it
occurred—but for the anguish they were costing me.</p>

<p>But she kept her countenance, like a mighty actress, that
she might quaff her enjoyment at leisure to the dregs.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand what you say, Mr. Orchardson. It
is simply impossible that poor Kitty, that your bride, that your
dear wife you were so wrapped up in, should—should have run
away from you.”</p>

<p>“I cannot say whether she ran, or walked, or how she went—but
she is gone.”</p>

<p>“You astound me. Geraldine, you had better leave the
room. Such things are not fit for good young girls to listen
to. Now, Mr. Orchardson, tell me all about it. But first
accept my sincere condolence. Although, as you know, I was
against the marriage, mainly for your sake, I can assure you.
I knew her so well—but so soon, oh, so soon! I could not
have expected it, even of her. And did she inflict these sad
wounds, before she went? A tender remembrance? Oh, it is
so sad! But one thing I must beg of you—do not be soured
by it. Do not conclude, as most young men would—that all
women are bad, because this one has proved so ungrateful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
you. And after seven years of desertion, I believe you will
be at liberty to take a better wife.”</p>

<p>“I want no better wife. There could be no better wife.
I love her with all my heart, in spite of this mistake. And I
will never look at another woman, while I live.”</p>

<p>“What a noble husband! How could she run away?
And doubtless with some ignoble wretch—no other would have
taken her from your arms. But when did it happen? Do tell
me all about it. And who has supplanted you, so very, very
quickly? One would hardly believe it in any story-book.
And you so devoted—oh, how your heart must ache! Do let
me order you a glass of wine.”</p>

<p>“No wine, thank you. And I cannot tell the story,
which would only increase your affliction, madam. Only one
thing, in justice to my wife. No one has supplanted me in her
affection. She is as true to me, as I am to her. She has been
misled by some despicable trick. And, by the God in heaven,
I will kill the man who did it.”</p>

<p>“No horrible oaths before me, young man!” Her face, lips
and all, turned as white as a sheet, as I spoke with the whole
fury of my soul in voice and eyes,—the wrath of a quiet man
wronged of his life.</p>

<p>Then we gazed into one another’s eyes, until she was
obliged to turn away.</p>

<p>“I could not expect you to have good manners,” she said,
after sitting down, and expecting me to begin; “if you behaved
like this, before your wife, there might be some excuse for her
running away. She has been used to the society of gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“And that she has had in a humble way, since she became
my wife. You must thank yourself for what I said; for you
laboured to goad me up to it. And I mean it, madam. I
spoke with no profanity. I am not given to swearing. Whoever
has done me this foul wrong has ruined my life, and shall
pay for it with his own. Give him warning of this, if you
know who he is. I have nothing more to say than that.”</p>

<p>Fear for the moment overcame her fury. And I left that
house, with the firm conviction that my misery as well as my
happiness, had proceeded from it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.<br />

<small>MET AGAIN.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Hotchpot Hall</span> has been a fine old place, as any one would
say who looks at it; and it would have been a fine place still,
if the owners had been of like quality. “It taketh its name,”
says an old county book, “from a very ancient rule of law,
that if sisters be in coparcenary, as heiresses to landed estate,
and one of them hath from the same source a several estate
by frank-marriage, she shall (as is just and seemly) bring that
into <i>hotchpot</i>, which signifieth a mixture for a pudding, ere
ever she can enjoy rights with the rest.”</p>

<p>Whether that be correct or otherwise, is far beyond my
power to say, for I know not what “frank-marriage” is—nor
for the matter of that “coparcenary”—but at any rate there
stands the house, which savours in some degree of a pudding,
being built of many-coloured stones; and the people for
several generations have taken their name from this old place.</p>

<p>Though it stands in the midst of a flat and dreary country,
with good corn-land spread among desert fens, and fewer and
smaller trees than ours—for the glory of Middlesex is the
noble elms—yet the house has the advantage of a fine rise
towards it, and a wide and open view for many miles across
the level. This gives it the air of an important mansion, and
one that deserves to be kept in good repair. But for three
generations now, the owners had been coming down in the
world, by reason of bad times, as they themselves declared,
but as anybody else would say, of their own badness. Till
the last successor had scarcely the right to call himself the owner.</p>

<p>Sir Cumberleigh Hotchpot was of good descent, if name
may stand for nature, on his mother’s as well as his father’s
side; for his mother had been Lady Frances Cumberleigh, the
daughter of a North-country Earl. But she had brought no
increase to the family estates, and had rather assisted to lessen
them. And her son had pursued the same course, by gambling,
and a dissipated and rambling life. It was only by sufferance now
that he dwelt, when he fled from London creditors, in one wing of
the old house, till some one could be found, who would take it
upon a repairing lease, for it could not be sold to advantage.</p>

<p>This baronet was cunning, though he was not wise; and in
spite of all misfortune, he relied on little tricks to keep himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
going, while he still hoped to indulge in devices on a larger
scale, to fetch himself round. He took good care to reap his
gains with the keenest promptitude, while he left his losses to
be gleaned by very tardy process. And this had tended, more
than once, to impair his popularity.</p>

<p>Sam Henderson came and said to me, while I was
thinking what next to do, after getting the better of one enemy—“Would
you like to see old Crumbly Pots?” Sam had
been making money lately, and scorned anybody who could not
pay up—“It might do some good, and can do no harm. He is
ducking his head among his moats and meres because he was hard
hit at Ascot. He owes me five ponies; he was ass enough to back
that cur <i>Sylvester</i>, a nag who lays his ears back, the moment he
is collared. I am pretty flush now, and I don’t care to squeeze
him; but I’m going to the July, for one more spree, before
being tethered finally. He won’t dare to show his mug there;
but you and I could toddle on to his earth, afterwards.”</p>

<p>I told Sam plainly that I did not understand the meaning
of his overture. But he only replied—“Then the more fool
you. Can you understand this—I am going to the July meeting
at Newmarket, where the best two-year-olds of the season
come out, and you may see five or six of old Chalker’s string.
It would do you a deal of good to see them, and take your
mind out of your own hat; though you don’t know a racehorse
from your old <i>Spanker</i>. If you like to come with me
I will stand Sam, according to the meaning of my name and
nature. I shall make another hatful of money there, for
cockering up the bridesmaids, and that sort of thing; and
after that we might rout up old Hotchpot.”</p>

<p>I perceived that Sam’s meaning was most friendly, and
after consulting Uncle Corny, who thought that I sadly wanted
change of scene, and a little more experience of the world, I
arranged to go with Sam to headquarters, as he called it, and
after the racing should be over to proceed to Hotchpot Hall,
in Lincolnshire. Sam could procure me admittance there; and
I longed to come face to face with my old rival.</p>

<p>With the racing I was pleased, as any man must be at
beholding noble animals, and hoping that the best of them
may win. Of the thousand guiles and wiles, that defraud
them of fair play, I was happy enough to know nothing, and
believed that the two legs across them were as honest as their
four. Yet I wondered sometimes; and it proved how little
one may judge of quality by appearance, and how true the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Holy Scriptures are, when the horse that seemed likely to be
last came first.</p>

<p>Of Sam I saw little, for he was too busy, going the round
both of stables and of houses, and forming opinion less by eyes
than ears, and most of all by his own conscience, which told
him how he would have acted in the position of the rest. Sam
had a conscience not only nimble but extremely sensitive,
which enabled him to judge that of other sporting men perhaps
less highly gifted. For these he charitably made allowance,
forgiving their defects when he pocketed their money.</p>

<p>“I have not done so badly,” he said on Friday night; “I
made a fine hit through old Roper. That old chap is worth a
mint to me, for I know every twist of his grand old mind.
The professionals were cocksure that <i>Columbine</i> was meant,
and she could not have lost if she had been. How much have
you won, Kit? I put you up neatly. You might have made
a hundred, without risk of a hair.”</p>

<p>“Well, I only bet half a crown, and that I lost. I think
<i>Spanker</i> could have beaten most of them. They don’t seem
to me to go at any pace at all.”</p>

<p>“That is what a greenhorn always thinks. If you were
on their backs you would soon find out the difference. Well,
let’s have some supper, and be off by the night mail. But
you look queer. Have you met any one you know, old
chap?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul that I know, except Mr. Chalker; and I only
know him by sight. But this afternoon I saw a face that I
have seen before, though I have no idea who the owner is. I
looked for you to tell me, but I could not find you.”</p>

<p>“Very likely not. I went to see the saddling. You seem
in a way about it. What makes you take it up so?”</p>

<p>Upon this I told Henderson about the man who had
gazed at me so, through the clipped <i>Arbor vitæ</i>; and that
now I had seen the same man in the throng on the Heath, and
could swear to him anywhere. At first he was inclined to
laugh, and thought I must have dreamed it; but seeing how
serious and positive I was, he naturally asked how it was I let
him go, without at least ascertaining who he was. I told him
that I had done my best; and that I believed the man knew
me, for our eyes met point-blank, until he turned his away.
And then I had pushed through the crowd to seize him, but a
fat man on horseback came clearing the course, and a rush of
some hundreds of people swept us back, and when I could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
out of it, the man had disappeared. I described him and his
dress, to the best of my ability; and then Sam gave a whistle
and said—“I don’t think it can be. He can scarcely have
been here without my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“You recognize him? Who is he?” I asked with some
excitement. “Don’t keep it back, Sam. It is most important
to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, the face, and the hat, and the green pearl in the
scarf-pin remind me uncommonly of Downy Bulwrag; though
I do not know him very well; and it can hardly be. He is
out of England, I am told, and if he had been here I should
have met him in the ring. For he always comes to bet, and he
is a very deep file, though he knows very little of racing. He
comes to invest for old Pot sometimes, and it is the only time
Pot ever makes any money.”</p>

<p>“But he may have gone off, when he saw me,” I said;
“he would hardly dare to run the risk of meeting me again.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t he? It would take ten of you to drive him.
Downy Bulwrag is the coolest hand I ever came across. I give
him a wide berth myself; for there is nothing but bad luck to
be made out of him. He is worse than his mother, a thousand
times; and everybody knows what she is. I am very glad you
missed him. For he would have had the best of you.”</p>

<p>“Would he indeed?” I exclaimed rather hotly. “I am
not a milksop, Sam; and I fear no man on earth, when I have
reason to believe that he has wronged me.”</p>

<p>“You are strong enough, Kit,” Sam returned, with some
contempt; “we are all aware of that, my friend. You are
stronger, I dare say, than Downy Bulwrag, although he is no
chicken. But he is one of the first boxers in England. He
has made a hobby of it. He can hold his own with the biggest
prize fighters. He could double you up, before you got near
him. And it is not only that, my boy. Likely enough he
would not have touched you; for he never loses his temper
they say. He would have had you up before the Bench to-morrow.
He can always put anybody in the wrong. And
then how should we have gone on to-night? No, it was a lucky
thing that you got no chance to tackle him, supposing it was
Downy, which I scarcely can believe. All the fellows are
gone who could have told me. But I dare say I shall find
out in London. Now let us have some grub, or we shall miss
our train.”</p>

<p>Sam Henderson’s words set me pondering deeply. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
not intended to assault that stranger, whoever he might be, but
just to bring him to a halt, and make him tell me who he was,
and what he meant by coming on the sly into my uncle’s
garden, and watching me in that peculiar manner. Now I felt
pretty certain as to who he was, in spite of the difficulties Sam
had found about it. If my description tallied so closely with
that of Donovan Bulwrag, it was likely to be no one else who
had come so to spy upon me. For there was the motive at once
made plain. The man, who had robbed me of my wife, would
naturally come to see how I bore it, to learn perhaps what sort
of adversary I was, and to gloat upon my lonely misery. I
felt delighted when I called to mind that I had indulged in no
sighs or soliloquy that evening, but worked away steadily and
even cheerfully, whistling every now and then for company to
myself. My deadly enemy could not say—“Poor devil, how
miserable he looks!”</p>

<p>And then why should I have such a bitter enemy? I had
never done harm to this Bulwrag, except by marrying a young
lady upon whom he had set his wicked heart, but who never
would have had him, whatever he had done. And again I had
defied his mother, and thrown her into one of her furious fits;
but even if he had heard of that, it could not have moved him
to any great wrath. From all I had heard, he was not so very
deeply attached to his mother; and he must know, as everybody
else did, how little was enough to infuriate her.</p>

<p>As I thought of all these things in the train, with Sam
Henderson snoring, or rather roaring in his sleep (like a celebrated
horse who had won a race that day), the only conclusion
I could come to was that my case was more mysterious than
ever; that some fiendish trick had been played upon my wife
and me; but how, and why, and by whom, was more than my
simple, half-educated, country wits could discover as yet, or
perhaps at any future time. Nevertheless I resolved to go on,
and get to the end of it, whether round or square; whether it
might be another sweet circle of happiness, or a coffin. And
in this state of mind, being lifted for the moment out of the
body, by the hoisting of the mind, I set my hands together—for
it was a first-class carriage, and there was room to do it,
though it seemed to me a showy thing upon the part of Sam,
when third-class tickets would have done as well—and I prayed
to the Lord, which I had not done lately, having found it lead to
nothing, that He would interfere, and not allow everything to
be under the control of the Evil one. After that I felt better;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
for faith is a fruit-tree, which requires (in a common soil) the
choicest cultivation.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” cried Sam, who could sleep by the mile,
and be wide awake at the direction-post; “what a heavy-headed
chap you are! Just look to our bags, while I see about
a trap. We have five miles to drive, and then we put up at
old Cranky’s. There we have a shake-down, and I fare to
want it, as the folk in this part of the world express it. They
all know me here, and they have a black mare who can travel.”</p>

<p>For five miles we drove through a sleepy-looking land, with
scarcely anybody yet astir, but a multitude of birds quite wide
awake; and then we put up at a wayside inn; where Sam
seemed, as usual, to be well-known. He told me to take it
easy, and he set a fine example; for he very soon peopled the
house with his sleep, while I wandered about to see how the
land lay.</p>

<p>“Pots is never up till twelve o’clock,” Sam explained at
breakfast-time; “so you see we may just as well keep our hay
in cocks. I say, Cranky,” he addressed the landlord, who was
coming in and out, having no maid to attend to us, “What’s-his-name
been down this way lately? Fancied we saw something
of him yesterday.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not a sign of him, since you was here last. They
don’t seem to hit it off together as they did. Leastways that
was what my missus heard.”</p>

<p>“More chance of honest people coming by their due. How
much does Sir Cumberleigh owe you, Cranky? Take thy bill,
and write down quickly.”</p>

<p>“Lor’, sir, it would take a week to make it out. And what
good would come of it when done? Sir Cumberleigh never pays
nobody. No more than his father before him.” It were vain
on my part to attempt to express the long-suffering of
Mr. Cranky’s drawl.</p>

<p>“These are wonderful fellows,” Sam declared aloud to me
while the landlord looked at him, as if to say—“And so are
you,” and then turned to me to see if I were likewise; “they
never seem to expect to get their money from their betters, as
they call them. That cock would never fight, in our part of
the world. Any lady been down at the Hall, this summer,
Cranky? I mean any one, who has never been before? You
need not be afraid of telling me, you know. I am an old friend
of Sir Cumberleigh.”</p>

<p>This question was put in such a common sort of way, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
I dropped my knife and fork, and looked furiously at Sam.
For I knew what he meant; and it appeared to me too bad.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Cranky, leaning over him confidentially,
as if he were uncertain about speaking before me. “None but
the two as come last winter; and not so very much of them.
My missus did hear as Sir Cumberleigh were going to pull up,
and to enter into holy matrimony with a beautiful young lady
from London town, as had sixty thousand pounds of her own,
and then we should all be paid on the nail in full. And the
Hall was to be made new, and I know not what. But I said
it was too good to be true, and so it seemeth.”</p>

<p>“Hope for ever, good Cranky. Hope can do no harm to the
<i>Hotchpot Arms</i>. But how goes the time? We are going to
call upon this reformed gentleman, as soon as he is up.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV.<br />

<small>ROGUES FALL OUT.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> we walked very slowly through the wilderness of thistles,
which had once been a fair park trimly kept, I disturbed the
mind of Sam—which was busy with abstruse calculations of all
sorts of odds—by asking rather suddenly what I was to say, and
how I should conduct myself in the presence of this man. For
I felt a deep dislike to him, not only because he had been such
a plague to Kitty, but on account of his bad character and
loose ways. And my ill-will towards him had been increased
by his cowardly treatment—as it seemed to me—of the patient
people round him, and encroachment on their loyalty.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t ask me, my dear fellow,” answered Sam;
“the thing is out of my line altogether. You wanted to see
him, and here he is. I must leave you to the light of nature,
although he is rather a dark specimen. Perhaps he knows
nothing about your trouble. But he is up to most of Downy
Bulwrag’s tricks, or at any rate knows when to suspect him.
And if he has had a row with Bulwrag, and can see his way to
harm him, he will do it. For Pots is a very spiteful fellow.
You had better appear first as my companion. I can manage
not to let him catch your name; for he is rather hard of hearing,
though he won’t allow it. I shall work matters round till
Downy’s name comes up; and your business will be to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
your tongue and listen, until you can strike in with advantage.
He will see me, I think, because I wrote to tell him that I had
a little money for him. There is nothing like that to fetch
Pots.”</p>

<p>After a little reconnoitring from a window at the flank, we
were admitted by an ancient footman, who looked as if he never
got his wages, and shown into a shabby room, fusty, damp, and
comfortless. Here we waited nearly half an hour, while
Henderson drummed on the floor with his stick, and at last
began to blow a horn which he found behind a looking-glass.
Then the master of the house appeared, and shook hands with
Sam, and bowed to me.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to introduce a stranger, so that his name
shall be still unknown; and Sir Cumberleigh, not being quick
of hearing, received my name as “Johnson.” “On the turf?”
he inquired; and Sam said, “Yes; he has been on it every
day this week;” which was true enough in one sense; and I
longed to be back in a garden again, where we grow rogues, but
nothing like so many.</p>

<p>“Very glad to see you, very glad indeed, young sir.” This
gentleman offered his hand as he spoke; but I bowed, as if I
had not seen it. It may be a stupid old bit of priggery; but
no man’s hand comes into mine, while I am longing to smite
him in the face. And I could not help smiling at our host’s
new manners, so different entirely from what he showed in
London—unless he had been vastly misdescribed to me. He
pretended now to dignity and distance, and a fine amount of
grandeur; for no other reason that I could guess, except that
he was upon his native soil, breathing the air of his ancestral
vaults, and cheating folk who let him cheat because his fathers
did it.</p>

<p>But all this air of loftiness had no effect on Sam; who had
rubbed whiskers many times even with a Duke, when their
minds were moving on a good thing together.</p>

<p>“Got a bit of rhino for you, Pots,” he said, and I thought
it showed little good taste on his part, for Sam’s ancestors had
been stable-boys, and I have always been a good Conservative;
“not so much as I could wish; but every little is a help. And
everybody says that you are awfully hard up. Hope it isn’t
true; but we must have seen you at the July, if you had been
at all flush.”</p>

<p>“I have not been very fortunate of late,” replied the
Baronet, still keeping up his dignity on my account; “and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
property here has been much impaired by—by a lot of things
that did not come off. I was not at Newmarket, because I intend
to have nothing more to do with racing matters; which I must
leave to people who are sharper than myself, and have
different views of integrity. But anything really due to
me—”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had better not say any more about it;”
Henderson’s black eyes were twinkling with contempt. “I
had no right properly to receive the money; and if I had
thought twice about it, I should have refused, for I had no
commission from you to collect it; but Georgie Roberts knew
that I was coming to see you, and knowing me so well, he took
my receipt on your behalf, because he was anxious to square up.
I’ll just return it to him, and he can send you a cheque. I
heard a thing afterwards that put me in the wrong. Bulwrag
is the proper chap to act for you. And he seems to have been
there after all, but he cannot have turned up, till Friday. I’ll
send back these notes, and his receipt to Georgie.” Sam put
away his pocket-book, and looked contented; but Sir Cumberleigh
did not see it so.</p>

<p>“No, Sam, no! Business is business. I will write you a
receipt. How much did you say it was? Let me see. I forget
these trifles. Somewhere about eighty-five, if I remember.”</p>

<p>“Forty-five,” said Sam; and I was struck with the amount,
because it was the very sum that had so grieved me. “He had
forty against you upon the Levant. Downy managed that for
you.”</p>

<p>“Downy Bulwrag never did me any good, and he never
will;” said the Baronet sternly, yet looking round, as if afraid
of echoes. “He is always getting me into some vile scrape.”</p>

<p>“For instance, about the young lady at Hounslow. Did he
carry on any more with that affair?”</p>

<p>Sam put this question in the most off-handed manner, just
as if he had said—“Any news to-day?” But being unused to
any mystery on shuffling, I looked for the answer with extreme
anxiety, and Sir Cumberleigh observed it, and was put upon
his guard.</p>

<p>“How can I tell? I know nothing of his doings;” he
answered, with his eyes on me, while speaking to my friend.
“Downy is too deep for me; he is always up to something.
Mr. Johnson, do you know him? You almost look as if you
did.”</p>

<p>“No, I have never had that honour,” I answered as calmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
as I could; “I live in the country, and have little to do with
London, except when I am there on business.”</p>

<p>“Very well then, I may tell you, Henderson,” our host continued,
as he put aside the notes, after counting them, and
giving his receipt; “that Master Downy has not behaved of
late in a very friendly manner towards myself. He has not the
high principle, I am afraid, which has always governed my
conduct, at least in all matters of friendship and money. My
rule is rather to wrong myself, than any other living being.
We have held these estates for some centuries, Mr. Johnson;
and no Hotchpot has ever yet sullied the name. Fortune has
continually been against us; but we have borne ourselves
bravely, and won universal esteem, and even affection. I never
praise myself; but when my time is over, the same thing will
always be said of me.”</p>

<p>He spoke with such firm conviction that I was impressed
with his words, and began to feel sure that report must have
wronged him; until I thought of Kitty, who was no harsh
judge of character.</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” cried Sam; “you have done it well, Pots.
After that, you can scarcely do less than invite us to drink
your good health in a bottle of champagne.”</p>

<p>“That I will, with pleasure. Only you must excuse me,
while I see to it myself. The Hotchpots are down in the world,
Mr. Johnson, because we could never curry favour. We cannot
keep our butlers and our coach-and-four, and our deer-park,
as we used to do. Instead of that, I keep the key of my own
cellar. But I feel no shame in that. The shame lies rather—”</p>

<p>“Look sharp, old chap; I am as dry as a herring.” Sam
was always rough and rude in his discourse; and Sir Cumberleigh
set off, with a significant glance at me.</p>

<p>“He has taken a liking to you, the old rogue,” Henderson
informed me, when the door was shut; “because he believes
that you suck all his brag in, like a child. You stick to that;
it suits you well, for your face is no end of innocent. An old
stupe like that can be buttered up to anything, if it is laid on
by the right card. You don’t suck up to him, you see;
but you let him suck up to himself. We shall draw him
of everything he knows, and what matters more, everything
he suspects. Only you leave the whip-hand to me; green
you are, and green you will be to the last.”</p>

<p>“You are altogether out in that,” I said, though I knew
it was hopeless to reason with him; “you fellows, who see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
such a lot of fast life, are none the more sagacious for it. You
doubt what everybody says, unless you can find a bad motive
for it. And you generally go wrong in the end, because you
can only see black all round. But if this is a black sheep, you
take the shearing of him. Only I hate to go under a wrong
name.”</p>

<p>These words of mine proved that I was not a fool, at least
to my own satisfaction. Sam stared at me, as much as to say—“There
is more in you, than I thought there was;” but I did
not care to press the point; for he might take a huff, and say,
“Do it yourself, then.” Only I resolved to listen carefully, and
see if there was anything to be learned. And before he could
answer, our host returned, with a bottle of champagne under
each arm, and the old retainer following with glasses and a
corkscrew having a blade attached to it. And I thought that
he could not be bad altogether, but must at least have intervals.</p>

<p>“Henderson, will you oblige me by being our—what’s his
name? Diomede, or something. I have a touch of rheumatism
in one wrist. No corkscrew wanted, if the cork is cork,
and not wood, as a great many of them are. But he understands
it. Well done, Sam! Fill for Mr. Johnson first. Ah,
this is the right sort. Now we know what we are up to. Mr.
Johnson, your good health, and the same to you, Sam!”</p>

<p>“Sir Cumberleigh, here’s confusion to your enemies,” cried
Sam, standing up to give force to it; “and especially to one
whom I could name. Ah, he has led you a pretty dance, and
feathered his own nest out of it. However, we won’t say any
more about him. A downy fellow can’t help being downy.
Every man for his own hand, in this little world.”</p>

<p>“Sam, you know more than you have said. You go about
more than I do now. Do you mean to say, that he has let me
in purposely?”</p>

<p>“No, I never could believe that he would do it. It looks
rather queer, but it must be straight enough. No doubt everything
can be explained. You remember about <i>Flying Goose</i> at
least?”</p>

<p>They began to talk a quantity of racing stuff, which was
nothing but jargon to me; till Sir Cumberleigh rose from his
chair, and struck the table, glaring with his eyes, and turning
purple in the face.</p>

<p>“Then his name is not Bulwrag, but blackguard;” he
exclaimed, turning round to me, to attest it. “And as soon
as we meet, I shall tell him so.” Then he swore a round of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
oaths, which were of no effect, but to hurt himself, and turn
up the corners of the pity we were spreading for him. What
had he lost? Money only. I had lost more. I held my
tongue.</p>

<p>“You must not be too hard upon him;” Sam began to
soften, to make him harder. “Every man for his own hand.
Fair play, Pots; you would do it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Not for any one who trusted me. That makes all the
difference. He thinks he can do what he likes with me. He
shall find the difference. I know a trick or two of his that
would send him to the Devil, if I let out.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t talk about any secrets now;” said Sam
as cool as a cucumber, while I was like a red-hot iron; “his
private affairs are no concern of ours; and we don’t want to
hear of them. Johnson is a very steady-going chap, with a
wife and six kids. We won’t corrupt him, Pots.”</p>

<p>“Not much fear of that, if he is on the turf,” Sir Cumberleigh
replied, with a wink at me; “see a good bit of the
world there, don’t you, Mr. Johnson?”</p>

<p>I nodded my head, and turned away; for I never was much
of an actor, and now I could not trust my voice for words.
But Sir Cumberleigh was as full of his own wrongs, as I was of
mine in a different way.</p>

<p>“I know a thing or two,” he went on, becoming more
determined, as we feigned to check him, “that would stop his
little tricks for a long time to come. He would have to be off
to the Continent again, if I were to treat him as he deserves.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t do it, Pots. Forgive and forget; that’s the
proper tip nowadays. Who doesn’t try to let you in? It is no
concern of mine—but let us talk of something else. I dare
say he is a good fellow, after all.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” cried Sir Cumberleigh, working himself up; “I
may have done a thing or two, in my time. But I never
harmed man or woman, out of pure spite. Every man must
consider his own interest, and try to hurt no one, when it does
not help himself. That is my idea of the rule of life. But it
is not Master Downy’s, I can tell you that.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, old fellow. Let us drink his good health;”
Sam lifted his glass, but our host set down his. “Whenever
I hear a poor fellow run down, I begin to think of all that is
good in him. And I don’t believe Downy would hurt any one,
unless he was obliged to do it on his own account. He made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
pot of money, and he dropped a bit of yours. But you must
not score against him for a little thing like that.”</p>

<p>“It is useless to talk to you, Henderson. You have not
been hit, and you may whistle over it. But I’ll just ask Mr.
Johnson what he thinks, for I can see that he is a man of
proper feeling. Now what should you say, Mr. Johnson, of a
fellow, who wanted to marry a girl who did not like him,
because he thought she had a lot of money; and then when
she married a very quiet man, who took her without a halfpenny,
could not let them be happy with one another, but got
up some infernal scheme to separate them?”</p>

<p>“I should say he was a scoundrel too bad to be hanged;”
I answered with warmth unaffected; and I was going to say
more, but Sam checked me with a glance.</p>

<p>“Oh come, no fellow would ever do such a thing as that;”
he spoke with contemptuous disbelief. “Any man must be a
fool, who would get into such a scrape for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then Downy Bulwrag is a fool, as well as what you called
him, Mr. Johnson. I could tell you the story, if I chose; or
at least I could tell you a part of it. But it would not interest
you; and it is a long in and out of rascality. Well, I won’t
say any more about it; and I don’t know how he managed it.
But he will have a score to settle about that, some day.”</p>

<p>“That he will, and a bitter one;” I began, with hands
clenched, and heart throbbing; but Sam kicked me under the
table, and whispered, while Sir Cumberleigh was reaching for
the other bottle—</p>

<p>“Don’t be such a gone idiot. Leave it to me—can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I should have thought Downy was too sharp for that;”
Sam stroked his chin, and looked sceptical. “Of course, I
don’t know him as you do, Pots. But I should have thought
he was about the last man you could find to risk his hide for
mere larkiness.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that he risked very much. The young
man is in the agricultural line, and they are fair game for any
one, and have been so for the last twenty years. You may
stamp on those fellows, and they rather like it. By George, if
we treated the mill-owners so, they would have marched upon
London long ago. But a fellow with no kick in him must
expect to get plenty of it from his neighbours.”</p>

<p>These were my sentiments to a hair, coming straight to me
from Uncle Corny; and at any other time I should have struck
in boldly, with larger capacity of speech than thought. But to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
him who has no home to defend, politics are as a tinkling
cymbal, instead of a loaded cannon.</p>

<p>“What part of the world was it in?” Sam Henderson asked,
that the subject might not slip away; “that sort of thing would
never do in our part of the world; though we call ourselves
pretty rural still.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know exactly where it was. And we had
better not say any more about it.” Sir Cumberleigh became
suspicious at the first sign of direct inquiry. “After all, I dare
say there was no harm done. And perhaps the young fellow
was glad to be quit of all, before she had time to run up any
bills. Although she was a devilish nice girl, I believe. But
who could want more than three weeks of any woman? Except
for the sake of her tin, of course. Mr. Johnson, you agree
with me about that, I can see.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” I answered sternly, forgetting how I
wrecked my purpose by my indignation; “a good wife is the
greatest blessing any man can have. And the man who robs
him of her is no man, but is a Divil.”</p>

<p>“You had better set Johnson after your friend Downy;”
Sam Henderson struck in, as Sir Cumberleigh stared at me.
“You see how a Benedict regards the subject. And I shall
have to be of his opinion soon. Next week I shall lead to the
Hymeneal halter, who do you think?—give you three guesses,
and lay a fiver you don’t hit it.”</p>

<p>“Done with you!” cried our host, for I believe he knew.
“Three chances, Mr. Johnson, you heard what he said. No. 1,
Violet Hunter, such a stunning girl.”</p>

<p>“Wrong. Try again. No Vi Hunter for me. Wouldn’t
have her, if she was dipped in diamonds.”</p>

<p>“Well then, it must be Gerty Triggs, a fine young woman,
and five thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>“Wrong again. Only one go more. Have your flimsy
ready.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, it can’t be Sally Chalker. That would be too
much luck for a chap like you.”</p>

<p>“It is Sally Chalker, and no mistake. Though I’ll trouble
you to call her Miss Chalker, Pots, until she is Mrs. Henderson.
And I’d like to see any fellow come between us.”</p>

<p>“Hand over,” said Sir Cumberleigh; “well, Sam, you are
in luck. What a lot of things you will put us up to then!
Here’s to your happiness! Well, this is good news indeed.
Stop to dinner; we can have it early.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>But Sam declined the honour; and we soon set forth for
home, as nothing more could be extracted from our host, concerning
the matter which had brought us there. And Sam,
who understood him pretty thoroughly, felt sure that he had
already told us all he knew, and perhaps even more in the way
of mere suspicion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.<br />

<small>TONY TONKS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Once</span> I met a man who was a mighty swimmer, spending half
his waking time in the water, and even sleeping there sometimes,
according to his own account; though I found it rather
hard to believe that altogether. But one thing he told me,
which I do believe, because it is not so far out of the way, and
the same thing might have happened to myself almost.</p>

<p>He had made a wager to swim across one of those inlets, or
arms of the sea, which may be found upon our western coast,
where the tide runs in with great force and speed, over a vast
expanse of sands.</p>

<p>The distance from headland to headland was less than he
had often been able to traverse; but, being a stranger on that
coast, he had not reckoned, as he should have done, upon the
power and strong swirl of the tide. By these he was soon so
swung about, and almost carried under, that the sand-hills,
where the people stood to watch him, stood still themselves,
instead of slowly gliding by. And the yellow current flaked
with white, across which he was striving, seemed to be the only
thing that moved.</p>

<p>He began to doubt about his destination, whether in this
world or the next; for the cup of his hands, as he fetched them
back, and the concave impulse of his feet as he spread his toes
behind him, seemed to tell nothing upon the vast body of
water he was involved in; there was no slide of surface along
his shoulder-blades, and his chin rose and fell at each labouring
stroke, without budging an inch from the dip or the rise. He
began to feel that he was beaten, and a quiet resignation sank
into the stoutness of his heart, such as a brave man feels at
death. And he never would have lived to tell the tale, except
for a big voice from the shore, the voice of the very man who
had the money hanging on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“Put your feet down, Tom,” he cried; “for God’s sake put
your feet down.”</p>

<p>The vanquished swimmer put his feet down, though he
thought it was his death to do it; and there he felt firm sand,
and stood, with the tide which had threatened to engulf him,
rippling round his panting breast, and lapping his poor weary
arms. There happened to be a spit of sand there, far away
from shore and rock, and known to the boatmen only. There
he stood, and renewed his strength, with cheers of encouragement
from the shore; and then, as the rush of the tide was
slackening, after filling the depths inshore, he threw his chest
forward upon the water, and fought his way safely to the landing-place.</p>

<p>“But I would not take the money,” he said; “if I had
taken that man’s money, I should have deserved to be drowned
next time.”</p>

<p>This appeared to me to be a noble tale, showing goodness
on both sides, which is the true nobility. And it came to my
memory now, because it seemed to apply to my present state.
I had battled long with unknown waters, and against a tide too
strong for me; and now, though still far away from land, I
had obtained firm footing. By what cross purpose and crooked
inrush, my power and pride had been washed away, was a
question still as dark as ever; but now I could rest on the firm
conviction, which had been only faith before, that my Kitty
still was true to me, though beguiled by some low stratagem.
And I knew pretty surely who had done it, though it might be
very hard to prove.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose a day,” said Uncle Corny, when I told him all
we had done and heard; “never mind me, or the garden. You
can make up for all that by-and-by; and you have left your
part in first-rate order. That scoundrel follows in his mother’s
track; but he is ten times worse than she is, because he keeps
his temper. You must try to do the same, my lad. It would
never do to have a row with him, and to take him by the
throat, as he deserves. There is nothing you can prove at
present. And the moment he knows that you suspect him, he
will double all his wiles and dodges. He might even make
away with your poor wife. He would rather do that, than let
you regain her, and convict him of his tricks.”</p>

<p>“Bad as he is, he could never do that. I cannot believe
that any person living, who knows what Kitty is, could raise
his hand against her. But the wonder is, where can he have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
put her? Gentle as she is, she is not a fool; and she would
never submit to be restrained by force. And all that sort of
thing is quite out of date now, at any rate in England.”</p>

<p>“So people suppose; but stranger things are done, even in
this country still. He may even have got her in a lunatic
asylum, after driving her out of her senses first. Or more
likely still, on the Continent somewhere. Why, they do worse
things than that in Spain, and in Italy, too, from what I have
heard. And as for Turkey—why, bless my heart, they keep
the women in sacks and feed them, till they are fat enough
for the Sultan. And you heard that he has gone abroad. Mrs.
Wilcox said so. That is what he has done with her; you may
depend upon it.”</p>

<p>“But she would not have travelled with him, uncle. He
would not have dared to take her into any public place. But
don’t talk about it; it drives me wild. I see nothing to do,
but to force him to confess, to get him away somewhere by
himself, and hold a pistol to his head. A blackguard is always
a coward, you know.”</p>

<p>“Nine out of ten are, but the tenth is not,” my uncle replied
sententiously; “no sort of violence will serve our turn.
We must try to be crafty as he is. The only plan I can see is
to have him watched, followed everywhere without his knowledge,
and not put upon his guard by a syllable from us. We
had no reason to do that till now; but now we have, for I feel
pretty sure that old Hotchpot was right. You ought to have
got more out of him.”</p>

<p>“It was not to be done. We tried everything. And I
believe he knows no more than this—that before they quarrelled,
the younger villain made a boast of it that he would
have his revenge, but never let out what his plan was. And
when Hotchpot heard that it had been done, he naturally concluded
who had done it. When we compared notes, Sam and
I agreed that in all probability there is nothing more than that.”</p>

<p>“It is very unlucky for us,” said my uncle, “that Henderson
is going to be married so soon. We cannot expect him to help
us any more, for a long time to come; and he has twice the
head that you have. I don’t mean to say for useful work, for
there you would beat him hollow, but for plotting, and scheming,
and all sorts of dirty tricks. He has been brought up to those
things from the cradle, and he can tell a lie splendidly, which
you cannot. You are much too simple and truthful, Kit, just as
I am, for dealing with rogues and knaves. And he knows a lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
more of the bad world than we do. He is hand in glove also
with a host of swells, such as you and I never spoke to. Why, I
never shook hands with a lord in my life, although I should do
it like a man—if he offered, mind, for I should wait for that.
And you are in the same condition.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. I shook hands with two at Newmarket,
and they seemed to think very well of me. But that reminds
me that I met the very man for our job, if he would undertake
it. And I believe he would, if we paid him well.”</p>

<p>“For spying upon Bulwrag, you mean, Kit. I can’t bear
the idea of spying, even on that fellow. But I fear we must
make up our minds to it, just as the police watch a murderer.
And as for the cost of it, I would go half, and I am sure your
Aunt Parslow would pay the other half. But what makes you
think that he would suit? A very sharp fellow is wanted,
mind. Not a bit like Selsey Bill.”</p>

<p>“If it must be done, he is the very man. But you shall
not pay a farthing, Uncle Corny; you have plenty to do with
your money. At any rate I will not ask you, until I have
spent all I have for the purpose. Your advice is quite enough
for you to give, and it is worth more than money. See what I
should have done without you now! I had made up my mind
to pursue that fellow, and seize him, and shake the truth out of
him. But I should only have shaken out a heap of lies, and
probably got locked up for my trouble. But I see that your
plan is the only wise one.”</p>

<p>“You are a sensible young fellow, Kit, when you have good
advisers. But who is this man of craft you were speaking of,
and how has he got experience for a job like this?”</p>

<p>“He has been brought up to every kind of nasty work; and
the nastier it is, the more he likes it. He is a spy on horses,
to watch them in their trials, and sneak into their boxes, and
learn everything they think of. It seems to be a regular profession,
where they keep racehorses; and Sam knows all about
this man. They call them Touts, or Ditch-frogs, or Sky-blinkers,
or half-a-dozen other names; but they get well paid,
and they don’t care. His name, or nick-name, is Tony Tonks,
which he takes from some story-book, I believe. He is a very
queer sort of fellow; if you saw him once, you would know him
always; not a bit like any of our folk down here. Sam says
he could canter round any of his chaps, and he would try to
afford him, if he did crooked work; but Tony is a costly
luxury.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind the cost. Your aunt shall pay; she has
nothing to do with all her cash, except to blow out a lot of
dogs, like footballs. But is this Tony to be trusted? He
might be a Jack of both sides.”</p>

<p>“That is just what he isn’t. And that is how he gets
double the wages of any other Tout. He puts his whole heart
into anything he takes up; and yet he is cool as a weazle. He
makes a point of honour of winning, Sam told me; and he
would rather pay money out of his own pocket, than be beaten,
whenever he takes up a job. And he is very small; he can
slip in and out, while people say—‘Oh, what boy was that?’
But I doubt whether he would take up this. He would have
made a wonderful jockey, I was told; and he rides as well as
the best of them. But he loses his head, when he is put upon a
horse, or he might be now making ten thousand a year. Nobody
can explain such things.”</p>

<p>“Nobody can explain anything;” my uncle replied with his
usual wisdom; “look at me. I have been in a garden all my
life, and I have kept my eyes open, and I am no fool. But if
you ask what canker is in an apple-tree or pear, or blister in a
peach, or silver-leaf, or shanking in grapes, or sudden death in a
Moorpark, or fifty other things that we meet with every day, all
I can say is—‘Go and ask the men of science, and if two of
them tell you the same thing, believe it.’ No, my lad, we know
nothing yet, though we find bigger words than used to serve the
turn. Have you told young Henderson, that you would like to
try this fellow, Tony Tonks?”</p>

<p>“No, I never thought of it, until just now, when you suggested
that the villain should be watched, to find out where he
goes, and all his dirty doings. It is fair play with such a deadly
sneak. But for all that, I hate the thought of it.”</p>

<p>“We must meet the devil with his own weapons. Sam is
going to be married at Ludred, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, next Thursday. And I have promised to be there.
Although it will be a bad time for me.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Kit. You shall have your time again. As
I have told you more than once. I am an old man now,
and have seen a lot of wickedness. But I never knew it
triumph in the end. Go up at once to Halliford, and get
your friend to write to this fellow by the afternoon post.
We might have him here to-morrow night, and settle matters
with him, while we have Henderson to help us.”</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to find Henderson at home, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
entered into our plan with zeal; for he had his own grudge
with Bulwrag. But he told me that we must be prepared to
part with a heap of money, if we began it; and he could not
tell how long it might last. I answered that we had a good
bank to draw on, and that I should be able to repay it in the
end out of my own little property, which I should insist upon
doing.</p>

<p>“Tony will want five pounds a week, and all expenses
covered; and you may put that probably at five pounds more.”
Sam looked as if he thought I could not afford it. “And then
if he does any good, he will expect a handsome tip. And you
must let him have his own head. He is the best man in England
for the job, if he will take it. And perhaps he will.
There is nothing on now in his line of business much, till the
Leger comes on. Tony will do a good deal for me. I shall put
it as a personal favour, you know. But we won’t tell him what
it is, until he comes to see.”</p>

<p>Busy as he was with his own affairs, Henderson wrote to
the great horse-watcher, and receiving reply by telegraph, met
him at Feltham the following afternoon; and after showing
him all over his own places, brought him to supper with us at
my uncle’s cottage at nine o’clock, as had been arranged in the
morning. And it was as good as a play—as we express it—and
better than most of the French plays now in vogue, to see my
solid uncle, with his English contempt for a spy, and strong
habit of speaking his mind, yet doing his utmost to be
hospitable, and checking himself in his blunt deliveries, and
catching up any words that might be too honest for the convenience
of his visitor. He told me afterwards that he felt
like a rogue, and was afraid of sitting square to his own table.</p>

<p>The visitor, however, did not in the least appreciate these
exertions, or even perceive their existence. He was perfectly
contented with his own moral state, and although he said little,
I could almost have believed that he regarded my good uncle
with as much superiority, as was felt—but not shown—towards
himself. And his principal ambition was to take in a good
supper.</p>

<p>Being concerned more than all the rest in his qualities, I
observed him closely, and became disappointed when he said
nothing of any particular astuteness. But perhaps, like most
men who have to work their brains hard, he allowed them a
holiday when off duty, and cared very little what was thought
of them then, if they came up to the scratch at signal. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
although he said little, what he said was to the point, and he
did not expend great ability in proving, as most men do, that
two and two make four.</p>

<p>His outer man was of such puny build, that when he sat
by my uncle’s elbow, it seemed as if he might have jumped into
the big pocket, wherein the fruit-grower was wont to carry a
hammer, a stick of string, a twist of bast, a spectacle-case full of
wall-nails, a peach-knife, a pair of clips, a little copper wire,
and a few other things to suit the season, according to its latest
needs. Tony Tonks glanced every now and then with great
curiosity at my uncle, and at this pocket which was hanging
with its weight under the arm of a curved Windsor chair; as a
fisherman likes to see his bag hang down, but only once in his
lifetime has that pleasure.</p>

<p>But though Tony Tonks might go (more readily than the
fish who won’t come at all) into that pocket, Nature had provided
him with compensation for his want of magnitude.
There never lived a very small man yet, who was not in his
own opinion big. Great qualities combine in him, of mind and
soul, and even of the body for the sake of paradox; so that no
one knows what he can amount to, but himself. And as the
looking-glass presents us with ourselves set wrong; so the
mirror of the man who weighs but half the proper weight, may
exalt him to the ceiling, if he slopes it to his mind.</p>

<p>Tony spoke little, but he spoke with weight, and expected
to be followed closely, when he gave us anything. And it became
pleasant to behold my uncle gradually forming a great
opinion of him, because he was not offered much to build it
on. Sam Henderson nodded very knowingly to me, and I
returned it with a wink behind my Uncle Corny’s head, when
the pipes were put upon the table, and the grower took the
clean one he intended for himself, and gave it (with a grunt at
his own generosity) to Tonks.</p>

<p>“Now we all know where we are,” began my uncle, as if a
puffing pipe had been the cloudy pillar; “the best thing, as I
have always found in life, is for people to know what they are
at, before they do it.”</p>

<p>Tony Tonks nodded, and my uncle was well pleased, both
to have the discourse to himself, and to perceive that the visitor
smoked slowly, and could dwell upon good things.</p>

<p>“You give us your experience and skill, for the period of
one month at least if needful, for the sum of five pounds a week
payable in advance, as well as travelling expenses, if required,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and lodgings. You report to us by post, when there is anything
to tell, and you come down at the end of every week, to let us
know how you get on, and to draw your money for the next
week. And you attend to nothing else, but the job you are
engaged on.”</p>

<p>“Nothing else. Never take two things in hand at once.”</p>

<p>“And the business you undertake for us is to find out everything
that can be found about the doings of Donovan Bulwrag.
Where he goes, who his companions are, what messages he
receives or sends, how he employs his time, what he is up to,
everything about him that is of interest to us. It seems a
nasty, shabby thing, but he has brought it on himself. We
can’t bear doing it; but it must be done.”</p>

<p>“Nothing shabby in it,” Tonks exclaimed with spirit, and
a quick flash in his small gray eyes; “trickey people must be
tricked.”</p>

<p>“A man who has wronged another man,” said my uncle,
putting it on a larger footing, “as that low scoundrel has
wronged us, has put himself outside of all honour. You know
the man very well by sight, I believe.”</p>

<p>“And by more than sight;” answered Tony, in a voice
that made us look at him. But as he offered no explanation,
we did not ask him what he meant, but concluded that he had
his own bone to pick with this crafty enemy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.<br />

<small>TOADSTOOLS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> arranged that our watchman—as my uncle called him,
thinking it much more respectable than spy—should hire a
room from our friend Mrs. Wilcox, who could help him in
many ways. For she knew all the habits of the house of
Bulwrag, and had useful friends in the kitchen there, and
could introduce Tonks to a distant view of the adversary’s
mother and sisters.</p>

<p>All this being settled, and everybody else in good spirits
about it, I fell suddenly into deep dejection, not on account of
Sam Henderson’s good luck, for that I rejoiced in and would
not think of, but simply from dwelling on my own hard fate,
and the sympathy aroused by it among all who knew me. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
as time went on, I was pitied more and more, and our neighbours
one and all made up their minds, that there never had
been a more unlucky fellow. And especially the women
looked at me in such a way, that when I could avoid them
without rudeness, it seemed to be a comfort to have business
round the corner.</p>

<p>This began to tell upon me more and more; for as no man
can see all the world for himself, but must take his view of it
from other people’s eyes; so even in his own affairs he finds
their colour affected by the light or shade that others cast upon
them. And labour as I might to think that every one was
wrong, and ought to be compelled to keep his mind to his own
business, yet when I had made all this most certain to myself,
a frosty fog and gloom of doubt would settle on my spirits, and
wrap me in a world of wonder having no straight road in it.
And what with one state of mind and another, sometimes the
pangs of memory, and sometimes the stings of fury, and worst
of all the heavy ache of listlessness and loneliness, upon the
whole it seemed less harm to be out of life than in it.</p>

<p>How it might have ended I know not, if it had not been
for something which I took to be an accident, and of no
importance to me more than any other meeting. One evening
after sunset, as the days were drawing in, though the summer
was still in its power and beauty, I was taking my usual lonely
walk in “Love Lane,” as the young people called it. There
had not been a night, whether fine or wet, from the time of my
loss to this moment, when I had failed of this lonely walk,
unless I was far from Sunbury. It was some little comfort to
end the day in pacing to and fro where last, so far at least as
knowledge went, my Kitty’s footsteps must have been.</p>

<p>And now, when the sunset tint was gone, and the sky
could be looked into like clear glass, and in the tranquillity of
summer night the flutter of a leaf might almost seem to be
caused by the twinkle of a star, I, the only unquiet creature—according
to the laws of man—was treading the same restless
round, and thinking the same endless thoughts, as when the
storm of evil fortune had been fresh upon me. Wrapt in my
own cares alone, and breathing only for myself—for absorbing
love in small men is but selfishness by deputy, and I in all but
outward form have been a small man always—here I plodded
without heed of grandeur, goodness, or the will of God.</p>

<p>But things are strangely brought about; and any one not remembering
this might laugh to hear how I was enlarged, and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
moment more ennobled than by all the stars of heaven, through
the sight of a white cotton handkerchief. A man climbed over a
gate into the lane, stiffly raising one leg first, and then after a
little pause the other, as if his active days were gone. And
probably I should not have seen him, for all his clothes were
black, unless he carried a white handkerchief. This was conspicuous
in the dark of the overhanging foliage; and it seemed
to be doubled up by the corners, and bulging with some bulk
inside.</p>

<p>“What can he have got in that?” thought I, and hastened
my steps to see, although it was no concern by rights of mine.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Kit—excuse me, Mr. Orchardson I
mean.” This was said in a kind and gentle voice; and I took
off my hat, for I saw that it was our parson, the Rev. Peter
Golightly, not our vicar, who was absent for the summer, but
the curate in charge of our parish.</p>

<p>“What a calm and beautiful night!” he resumed; “it
takes one out of one’s self almost. It makes our sorrows seem
so small.”</p>

<p>He might have talked like this for an hour, without any
effect of that sort on me; if he had not finished with a heavy
sigh, in spite of all the solace of the scene. Then I knew that
he referred to his own grief, which was a dark and bitter one.
He had lost his wife, just before he came to us; and now it
was said that his only child, a graceful girl of about fifteen,
was pining away with some mysterious illness, and would take
no food. And he, an old man of threescore and five, of feeble
frame and requiring care, must finish his earthly course alone,
poor, and forlorn, and with none to love him.</p>

<p>“I hope Miss Bessy is a little better,” I said very softly;
for I felt rebuked in my health and strength, by a grief like
this.</p>

<p>“No, I fear not. She fancies nothing. As I came back
from visiting poor Nanny Page, I saw some fine mushrooms in
the footpath field, and it struck me that possibly my child
would like them; though they are not very nourishing or
wholesome food. But if we could get her to eat anything—and
I have a special style of cooking them. But it was nearly
dark when I gathered them, and I scarcely know the true from
the poisonous. I was going to ask Dr. Sippets, but I fear he
would forbid them altogether. You could do me a great
favour, if you would. Just to look these over for me.”</p>

<p>This I undertook with the greatest pleasure, and asked him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
to come to my cottage for the purpose, where we could procure
a light. And I was pleased that he did not in any way attempt
to “talk goody,” as our people call it, nor even refer to my
lonely condition; though I knew by the softness of his manner
that it was present to his mind. The reverend gentleman had
collected his booty in too Catholic a spirit, mingling with the
true Agaric some very fine “horse-mushrooms,” and even one
or two poisonous toadstools. Having packed all the good ones
in a tidy punnet, which looked more enticing than his handkerchief,
I carried them for him to his own door, and obtained
leave to call on the morrow, and ask whether the young lady
had been tempted.</p>

<p>My Uncle Corny was one of that vast majority of good
Britons, which can never forbear the most obvious joke, even
when it is least attractive. The most fastidious people in the
world could scarcely call him “vulgar,”—which used to be a
favourite word with them—because he could let them call him
what they liked, and be none the worse for it. They might
just as well blame a dog for loving liver, or a cat for believing
that heaven is milk, as fall foul of my Uncle Corny, because he
ate the onions of very common jokes. He liked to make a
laugh; and when he failed, he perceived that the fault was
upon the other side.</p>

<p>“I thought of a capital thing,” he told me, “when I was
half awake last night, for I never sleep now as I used to do.
If you go on like this, you’ll have to answer to the parish
for it. What right have you to change our parson’s name?”</p>

<p>I saw by the wag of his nose that he was inditing of some
cumbrous joke; and I let him take his time about it.</p>

<p>“How slow you are! Can’t you see, Kit, his proper name
is Golightly; and you are making him go heavily. Well,
never mind. I can’t expect you to see anything just now. I
suppose you never mean to laugh again.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not at such stuff as that. What am I doing to
disturb him?”</p>

<p>“Why, you are getting into talks together, and heavy
proceedings about probations, and trials, and furnaces of
affliction, and all that sort of stuff, as I call it; instead of
coming to have your pipe with me.”</p>

<p>“There has not been a word of the sort;” I answered,
wondering how he could be so small. “Mr. Golightly leaves
all that for the Methodists. He is a churchman. And not only
that, but he is a man of true courage, and real faith in God. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
he could only give me a hundredth part of what he has, how
different I should be! And he never talks about it, but I know
that it is in him. Without a single word, he has made me
thoroughly ashamed of the way I go on. Look at him! A
poor old man, who can scarcely climb a gate, or lift a chair, and
who sees his one delight in this world pining and waning to the
grave before him. Yet does he ever moan and groan, and turn
his back on his fellow-creatures? Not he. He sets his face to
work, with a smile that may be sad, but is at any rate a pleasant
one; and he gives all his time to help poor people, who are not
half so poor as he is. I call him a man; and I call myself a
cur.”</p>

<p>“Come, come; that’s all nonsense, Kit. I am sure you have
borne your trouble well; though you have been crusty now and
then. And you can’t say that I have not made allowance
wonderfully for you. And here you are ready to throw me
over; because this man, whose duty it is, and who is paid for
doing it, sets a finer example than I do! I don’t call that a
Christian thing. Let him come and grow fruit, and have
to sell it, and if he keeps his temper then, and pays all his
hands on a Saturday night, and sets a better example than I
do—”</p>

<p>I burst out laughing. It was very rude; for my uncle was
much in earnest. But I could not help it; and after staring at
me, with a vacant countenance, he gave three great puffs of
tobacco and smiled as if he was sorry for me.</p>

<p>“Well, take him another bunch of grapes,” he said with
true magnanimity; “I am glad that the poor maid enjoys them.
And they are come down now to fifteen pence.”</p>

<p>Thus was I taken, without deserving any such consolation,
into a higher life than my own, and a very different tone of
thought. The bitterness, and moody rancour, which had been
encroaching on me, yielded to a softer vein of interest, and
sympathy in sorrows better borne than mine. The lesson of
patience was before me, told in silence and learned with love;
and it went into me all the deeper, because my pores were
open.</p>

<p>But in spite of all that, I saw no way to sudden magnanimity.
It is not sensible to suppose that any man can forego his ways,
and jump to sudden exaltation, just because he comes across
people of higher views than his. Women seem to compass
often these vast enlargements of the heart; but a man is of less
spongy fibre, if he is fit to marry them. It had been admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
by Tabby Tapscott, even in her crossest moments, that I was a
“man as any woman could look up to, if she chose.” And the
very best of them must not be asked to do that to a man, who
is like themselves. And so I continued pretty stiff outside,
and resolved to have my rights, which is the only way to get
them.</p>

<p>“Here comes Tony,” exclaimed my uncle, on the following
Saturday night; “time for him to show something for his
money. If there is anything I call unfair, it is to pay for a
thing before you get it. He will prove to his own satisfaction
that he has worked it out, of course. When you were at
Ludred about Sam’s wedding, you should have fixed your aunt
to something. Your fifty pounds is nearly gone; and she
never gave you another penny. I don’t see why I should pay
for it like this. And the French stuff is in the market already.
What’s the good of being an Englishman?”</p>

<p>“And what’s the good of being an Englishwoman?” I
answered, for I thought him too unjust, as he had not paid a
sixpence yet. “Unless she is allowed to dress sometimes, and
be told that she is twenty years younger than she is. Aunt
Parslow looked fit to be a bridesmaid quite. And she will
come down handsomely, when she has paid her bills.
She looked at her cheque-book, and she said as much as
that.”</p>

<p>“Then let her do it;” said my uncle shortly. “I suppose
this spy-fellow will expect his supper. Eat he can, and no mistake.
The smaller a man is, the more he holds. You had better
run down to the butcher’s.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tonks might have heard him, but he made no sign, only
coming up quietly with his tall hat on, and taking a chair which
stood opposite to ours; for the weather being friendly, and the
summer at its height, we were sitting out of doors, beneath the
old oak tree. Then he nodded to us, put his hat upon the
grass, and waited for our questions.</p>

<p>“Well, Tonks, what have you been up to all this time?
You have sent us no letter, so I suppose you have done
little?”</p>

<p>Thus spoke my uncle, looking at him rather sternly. I also
looked at him very closely, and was surprised to find a certain
strength of goodness in his face, which I had not observed,
when I first saw him. His face was thin and narrow, and his
cheeks drawn in, and his aquiline nose had had a twist to one
side. But the forehead was high and broad, and the lips and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
chin full of vigour and strong resolution. And the quiet gray
eyes expressed both keenness and resource.</p>

<p>“A thing of this kind takes a lot of time,” he said; “and
if you gents are not satisfied, you had better say so. I take no
man’s money, when he thinks it thrown away.”</p>

<p>“Hoity, toity, man, don’t be so hot,” my uncle replied,
showing much more heat himself; “we have not said a word.
We are waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“I have not done much. It was not to be expected. I
have cleared the ground for further work. It depends upon
you, whether I go on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure! Go on, go on. We give you your
head, and we are as patient as Job. I suppose you have found
out where that scoundrel is.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And I have found out something more than that.
I have struck up an acquaintance with him, and he does not
know me; though he ought, for he broke my arm last winter;
though perhaps he never saw my face. But I wore moustaches
and whiskers then, and a green shade through a little kick
from a horse. I know of a gambling-club he goes to, and there
I meet him every night. I have put him up to a trick or two;
and we are to rehearse them at his rooms to-morrow night. He
is very close; but I shall gradually worm him. But I must be
supplied with cash, to do it.”</p>

<p>“We will try to arrange about that,” said my uncle; “and
of course you can return it, and perhaps win some more.
Gambling is a thing I detest with all my heart; and no one
can ever win by it, in the end. If he did, it would do him no
good. But still, it is right that the rogues who live by it should
be robbed. If you pick up a pound or two there, all the better.
I think you have done wonders, Tonks. But I suppose you
have discovered nothing about—about the lady.”</p>

<p>“Not a single syllable yet,” he answered, looking at me, as
he caught my expression; “but I believe I shall, if I have my
time. What I have done is a great deal better than ‘shadowing’
the man, as they call it. I might do that for months,
and be no wiser. But I am obliged to be very careful. So
many people know me. I can never go near him where the
racing people are. And I have had one very narrow shave
already. But there is another thing you may be glad to know.
Bulwrag is beginning to make up to a rich lady. He is not
sweet upon her; but it seems that he must do it.”</p>

<p>“The thief!” exclaimed my uncle; “we must never allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
that. The scamp would break her heart. I am determined to
prevent it. I shall let her know my opinion of him. I know
all the villainous lot too well. Don’t be excited, Tonks. I
can’t stand that. Give me her name and address; and I will
go with the van myself, if necessary. I should think myself a
party to it, if I did not stop it. She will soon see what I
am.”</p>

<p>“I was going to tell you, but now I had better not,” Tony
Tonks answered with a sly dry smile; “what good could you
do, Mr. Orchardson? The lady would only laugh at you, even
if she deigned to see you.”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever laughs at me. And as for deigning to see
me,—why, the Queen herself would do it, the way I should
put it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have a good opinion of yourself. But you
must keep quiet in this matter, unless you want to spoil my
little game. The lady is the Lady Clara Voucher, daughter of
the Earl of Clerinhouse, a very great heiress, and not bad looking.
What more he can want is a puzzle to me. But it goes
against the grain with him.”</p>

<p>“He shall never have her; he may take his oath of that,”
said my uncle, bringing down his hand upon his knee, as if he
were the father of the peerage.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a curious affair,” thought I; “how can he be
taking to anybody else, after having cast his eyes on Kitty?”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.<br />

<small>THE DUCHESS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> these things compelled me to think about them, because
they were so different from what might have been expected.
When first I lost my wife, and knew that I had been robbed of
her, I made up my mind for savage work, and nothing could
be too wild for me. The greatest wrong that man can do to
man had been done to me; for a stab to the bodily heart is
better than the destruction of faith and love. But the care for
my dear wife’s good name, (which would have been blasted, if
ever it got abroad that she had eloped with the money), as well
as many other tender thoughts, had kept me quiet, and conduced
to stop me from any acts of violence. And this instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
of true love proved quite right; as all will confess who care to
know the end of it.</p>

<p>Straitened as I was with my own cares, and sometimes
buried in them, I could not help trying to lift if it were but
the corner of the burden imposed by Heaven upon a man a
thousandfold better and more noble. The only excuse I could
make to myself, for the different way in which he bore his
grief, was that he was bound to do it as a clergyman, and being
so old, must be getting used to it. But I knew in my heart that
this was paltry stuff; and that the true reason of the difference
was, that he was a large man with faith in God; while I was
a little one relying upon self. There was no way before me to
cure that, for no man can set up his ladder on a cloud; still it
did me good to know that he had found staple support, and was
steadfast upon heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Golightly was not only a Christian, but a gentleman.
Far as I was below his rank in life, he never let me feel the
difference, either by word, or turn of manner, or even by tone
of silence. He never inquired into my affairs, though no
indifference prevented it; and nothing was further from his
mind than the thought that he was doing good to me. Being
of a nature which requires something to love, I loved this man,
and never could see anything to laugh at in him, as my Uncle
Cornelius made believe to do.</p>

<p>I became restless if any day went by without my seeing
him, and I could not sleep on my two chairs, however tired I
might be, without the remembrance of his—“Good-night, God
bless you, Kit”—which he always gave me, in a gentle voice,
and with a look which was itself a blessing. And now I had
been admitted to the acquaintance of his darling; whom he
loved as I loved Kitty, but with a holier sense and fear. She
was lying on a horsehair sofa, in his poorly furnished room; for
he was poor, as a good man is nearly always somehow. And I
never shall forget the look she gave me from her weary eyes,
quite as if the depth of kindness were enhanced by its want of
power. And she rose upon one wasted arm, and offered me a
hand just like a white kid glove, that has been drawn off.</p>

<p>“You have been very good to father;” she looked at my
sunburnt face, as if she would like to remember it somewhere
else; “and what lovely grapes you bring me! See, how
greedy I have been!”</p>

<p>It was as much as I could do to keep my eyes from being
like grape-stalks; and I tried to drive my sorrow inwards, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
thinking that all of it was wanted there. But it would not do,
and I turned away.</p>

<p>“What she wants is outdoor air;” I said, as soon as we left
the room, and her father asked me what I thought; and I said
it more to hide my own distress, than from any hope at all.
“Outdoor air without exercise, and with very gentle movement.”</p>

<p>“Sims, the flyman, is very good;” her father’s lips
trembled as he spoke, and he tried to make a smile of it; “he
knows that we cannot afford much carriage-hire, and he comes
at half-price when he has nothing else to do. But since the
other spring broke, she can hardly bear it. She fainted twice,
the last time we went.”</p>

<p>“But the river, the water, the Thames!” I said, almost
fearing to make a suggestion so stale, “what can be more easy
than the gliding of a boat? Is that even too much for her?”</p>

<p>“Bessy has never tried it yet,” said the anxious father,
pondering much; “when I was at Oxford I loved the river;
but I have not found time for it for many years. And I fear it
would be cold upon the water.”</p>

<p>“It is much more likely to be too hot;” I answered, with
some wonder, at the clear unselfishness of this man, who loved
the river, yet lived upon its banks, without ever taking boat,
for fear of slighting duty; “the sun strikes very strong upon
the river; but after four o’clock it is delightful. I know a
boat that would exactly suit her. She can lie upon the cushions
in the stern. The weather is beautifully calm and warm. Will
you let me try it?”</p>

<p>He was loth to consent without leave from Dr. Sippets,
which of course was right enough; but the doctor said it was
the very thing he was going to recommend that very day; and
as soon as the poor girl heard of it, she would scarcely hear of
any other thing. We had an old boat of our own, but it was
not nice enough for her; so I went as far as Shepperton for the
one of which I had spoken to him. This was a very commodious
affair, and the name painted on it was <i>The Duchess</i>, obliterating
the old name <i>Emmy Moggs</i>; for a genuine duchess had been
in it, while staying for her health at Walton. Phil Moggs was
the owner, and he raised his price, as soon as he had painted
out his good wife’s name. And he thought so much of this
boat now—though described by rivals as the washing-tub—that
he always insisted on going with it. However, he was not
a bad sort of fellow, though belonging henceforth by his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
account, to the higher aristocracy. The cheaper men called
him “the Duke,” and he accepted the title without ill-will.</p>

<p>Regardless of expense, I hired boat and him, under private
agreement that Mr. Golightly should pay him half a crown, and
suppose that all. And we brought the young lady in a bath-chair
to the bank, and shipped her without any difficulty. And
it was worth a lot of money to behold her fair young face,
delicate with dreams of heaven, taking the flush of the firmer air,
and gradually kindling with the joys of earth. She looked at
every tree we glided past, and every fair garden upon either
bank, and every feathered bend of hill and hollow, as if they
were coming to her in a dream, yet so that she could make
friends of them. At first her dear father clasped her hand, as
if she could glide more smoothly so; but soon she became
more independent, and wanted both hands, to point out her
delight. Then the tears of kind pleasure came into his eyes,
and he turned away, and looked at the world for himself, and
thanked God for this little touch of happiness.</p>

<p>“Shall we rest a minute beneath this willow?” he said, as
the sun drew along the stream, and the myriad twinkles of
bright air seemed to be dancing to the silver chord of
waves; then we slid into the silence of a cool arcade, and I
said,—</p>

<p>“It is high time for Moggs to have some beer.”</p>

<p>Mindful of this prime need of every British waterman, I
had brought a little stone jar from my uncle’s tap; and thinking
that the savour of this fine beverage might not be agreeable
to our fair freight, I landed on the island, with a wink to “the
Duke;” and he very kindly followed me. The Pastor knew
well that his flock must be fed, and he extended his knowledge
to the neighbouring parish.</p>

<p>There was lemonade and strawberries for the weaker
vessels; and while they remained afloat, and entered into these,
Moggs and I sat behind a bush, and considered what was good
for us.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t often come Sunbury way;” I said,
just to lend a little tongue to tooth-work; for I had bought
some bread and a hunk of bacon.</p>

<p>“Nobs goes mostly up the river, Chertsey, and Laleham,
and the Mead, and that likes,” Mr. Moggs replied, with his
knife upon the bone. “Ain’t been your way, pretty nigh three
months.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, but you had a nice time then. Very fine ale at the
<i>Flower-pot</i>, Moggs.”</p>

<p>“Well, so there he; but quite as good nigher home. And
I likes my drop of beer, without no water in it. Here’s your
good health, Mr. What’s your name.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Moggs; and the same to you. But I don’t
understand about water in your beer.”</p>

<p>“Well, did ever you see a young ’ooman cry enough to fill
a bucket, let alone a boat? I pretty nigh wanted one of them
tarpaulins. Just lost her Daddy, the old man said to me.
But he told me not to speak of it; no more I did. But I
found out arterwards all about it. Seems she come from
Molesey, though I took her t’other side.”</p>

<p>“From Molesey? I know a good many of the people
there. The only man who died there this summer, to my
knowledge, was an old bachelor by the name of Powell. What
was this young woman’s name?</p>

<p>“Watson, or Wilson, I won’t be certain which. Never
mind; I dare say she’s all right by now. The more they takes
on at first, the sooner they gets shut.”</p>

<p>“But you took her on our side of the river, as you said.
Did you go to fetch her? What day was it? What was she
like? Who sent you for her? Where did you land her?
How came you—”</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. What’s your name. You hires my boat,
and you hires me to row; but not to go on about other people’s
business.”</p>

<p>“But it may be my own business, Philip Moggs. And
you may get into desperate trouble, by refusing to tell me all
you know of it.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit feared of that,” the old man answered; “I’ve
a-knowed hundreds get into trouble with too much clacking,
but never one the other way.”</p>

<p>He shut up his mouth, and looked like an old villain of a
horse I had seen at Sam Henderson’s, who had pits above his
eyes, and ears that stuck back like a gun-cock, and a nose that
was as wiry as a twisted toasting-folk. This was a man who
would whistle on his own nails to warm them, but not to warn
another man from going down a weir-pool.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “never mind; I don’t suppose it matters”—for
I was able to master my manners now, after three months
of endurance; “only somebody has a bit of money upon
something; and you might cut in for it, if you gave a hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
But I’ll be bound you know nothing about it, after all. You
fellows, who are always on the water, dream all sorts of stuff,
just as I did this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Then, Mister, I’ll just keep my dreaming to myself. I
did hear of something queer down your way. But least said,
soonest mended. Time to be shoving off again.”</p>

<p>On the homeward row, I did my best to drive out of my
mind all thought of this ancient mariner, and his story. And
he feigned not to be thinking of it; though I caught his
wrinkled eyelids dropping suddenly at the sudden glances
which I cast upon him. He was watching me narrowly, when
I looked away; and I thought it likely that he would land
again when he had discharged us, and try to learn all about me
in the village. For we at Sunbury knew but little of the
Shepperton people at that time, looking on it rather as a goose-green
sort of place, benighted, and rustic, and adverse to good
manners. Shepperton, without equal ground, despised us, as
a set of half-Cockneys, and truckling for the money of London,
which they very nobly contemned, because they got so little of
it. If anything exciting came to pass at Sunbury, these odd
people shrugged their shoulders, and talked about Bow Street,
and Newgate, and the like; as if they belonged to Middlesex,
and we to London. However, there can be no doubt which is
the finer village.</p>

<p>I was much dissatisfied with myself, when I came to think
of it, for allowing as I did this boatman’s story so to dwell
upon my mind, that even the fair invalid in the stern lost
many little due attentions. But happily she fell fast asleep,
being sweetly lulled by the soft fine air, and the dreamy melody
of waters. Her long eyelashes lay flat in the delicate hollows
of her clear white cheeks, where a faint tinge of rose began to
steal, like the breath of a baby angel.</p>

<p>“How beautiful she looks!” I whispered to her father, as
he gazed at her; and he answered—“Yes. How can I bear
it? It is the beauty of a better world.”</p>

<p>But he was in livelier mood about her, when we took her
gently home; and she rose from the chair with a rally of
strength, and he said, “Well, Bessy, how do you feel now?”</p>

<p>“As if I wanted a good tea,” she answered; “and as if I
never could thank this gentleman for the pleasure he has given
us.”</p>

<p>I wondered whether in trying ever so feebly to give
pleasure, I might have won, without earning, some great good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
for myself; and off I went (after proper words) to follow the
course of the <i>Duchess</i>.</p>

<p>In a minute or two, I had gained a spot which commanded
the course of the river; and there I perceived that the unmistakable
Moggs, instead of hastening home, was resting on
his oars to watch the bank, and make sure that no one was
watching him. I slipped into a quiet niche, which made me
think of Kitty; for here I had seen her surveying the flood,
in the days of my early love for her. It had been a happy
place that day; would it help me once again?</p>

<p>Presently Moggs made up his mind, if haply it had been
wavering; and pulling into the evening shadows, sought a
convenient landing-place. Then he fastened the <i>Duchess</i> to a
stump, and stiffly made his way towards that snug little
hostelry the <i>Blue Anchor</i>, favoured by most of our waterside
folk.</p>

<p>“That will do,” thought I; “he has conquered his contempt
of Sunbury. He is going to pick up all he can about
me. There must be something in it. And now for the Molesey
story.”</p>

<p>Without delay I returned to our village, and through it
hastened to the landing, where our ancient boat was kept.
There was no fear of meeting Moggs down here, for he was a
good half-mile above. Pulling leisurely down stream, I began
to think how stupid we had been in our inquiries, at least if my
present idea proved correct. But the policemen, to whom we
had entrusted the first part of the search, must bear the blame
of this stupidity. They had not failed to make inquiry among
the boatmen, and along the river; although their attention had
been directed chiefly to the roads and railway. But they
had assumed throughout that the fugitive must have gone
towards London, and as regarded the Thames, they had only
cared to inquire much down stream. Up the river there was
as yet no railway, and no important road; and with their
usual density, they had searched but very vaguely hereabout.</p>

<p>At Molesey I had friends who knew every item of what
happened there; and they soon convinced me that no young
woman weeping for her father’s recent loss was likely to have
quitted that good village, east or west, at the time in question.
Therefore Phil Moggs had been deceived, whether by his passenger
or others, as to that part of the story.</p>

<p>I was greatly surprised to find how little the general mind
of Molesey seemed to be concerned about my case. Few seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
even to have heard of it; and the few who did know something
knew it all amiss, or had put it so, by their own imaginations.
Indeed I could scarcely have guessed that the story, as recounted
there, had aught to do with my poor humble self. Even Uncle
Corny—great in fame at Sunbury, and even Hampton,—was
but as a pinch of sand flung from a balloon, to these heavy
dwellers in Surrey!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.<br />

<small>CRAFTY, AND SIMPLE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Does</span> it lighten a man’s calamities, or does it increase their
burden, to know that they are spread abroad and talked of by
his fellow-men? No man wishes to be famous for his evil
fortune; and as for pity, he is apt to be alike resentful, whether
it is granted or denied. But that is quite another point.
Without a bit of selfishness, and looking at their own interests
only, I certainly had a right to complain that an outrage which
must move the heart of every honest husband, and thrill the
gentler bosom of his faithful wife, had scarcely stirred a single
pulse at Molesey; just because the river ran between us.
None of the papers (except one that we subscribed to, at an
outlay of four and fourpence per annum) had taken up my case
with any fervour; as sometimes they do, when there is nothing
in it, like a terrier shaking a skull-cap. This depends on chance;
and all chances hitherto had crossed their legs against me, so
that I could bring forth no sound counsel.</p>

<p>When I told my uncle of my last suspicion, and that I could
go no further with it, because of the stubbornness of Phil Moggs
he became so enraged that I saw he was right.</p>

<p>“What!” he exclaimed—“that old hunks dare to refuse
any further information! I wonder you did not take him by
the neck, and hoist him clean over the tail of his <i>Duchess</i>. No
doubt you would have done it without the young lady. He
would never dare to try it on with me. Why I knew him when
he dug lob-worms at the Hook. He has forgotten me, I daresay.
Well, I’ll remind him. You shall pull me up there to-morrow
morning. One way or the other, we’ll crack his
eggshell. I could never have believed it of him.”</p>

<p>It did not concern me to inquire; but so far as I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
make out what my uncle meant, he was not at all pleased with
Mr. Moggs for having got on in the world so well. No man
can satisfy his friends in that respect; unless he makes so big
a jump that he can lift them also, and even so he never does it
to their satisfaction.</p>

<p>“To think of that fellow,” my dear uncle grumbled, all the
way to Shepperton, “owning half a dozen boats, and calling
one of them the <i>Duchess</i>! Why, I gave him an old pair of
breeches once, that he might not be had up for indecency.
And now he calls my nephew, ‘Mr. What’s your name!’ Do
you know who his wife was? No, of course you don’t. But I
do. Why, she was in the stoke-holes at old Steers’, the pineapple
grower at Teddington. And no one knew whether she
was a boy or a girl, with a sack and four holes in it, for her arms
and legs. But what a lot of money they made then! He sold
all his pines at five guineas apiece to George the Fourth, and
sometimes he got the money. Ah, there will never be such
days again. You must scrimp and scrape, and load back from
the mews, and pay a shilling, where they used to pay you to
take it. But here we are! Let him try his tricks with me.”</p>

<p>Unluckily my uncle got no chance of terrifying Mr. Moggs,
as he intended. We landed at a very pretty slab-faced cottage,
covered with vines and Virginia creepers, and my uncle began
to shout—“Moggs, Phil Moggs!” quite as if he were a
Thames Commissioner. But no Moggs answered, nor did any
one appear, till my uncle seized a boat-hook, and thundered at
the door. Then a very respectable-looking woman, with a
pleasant face and fine silver hair, came and asked who we were,
and showed us in. She seemed to know my uncle very well,
though he was not at all certain about her.</p>

<p>“Is it possible, ma’am, after all these years,” he began in
his best manner, “that I see the young lady I once had the
pleasure of knowing as Miss Drudger?”</p>

<p>“You see the old woman, who was once that girl,” she
answered, as she offered him a chair; “ah, those indeed were
pleasant days!”</p>

<p>I thought of the stoke-hole, and could well have believed
that my uncle had been romancing, if I had ever known him
capable of that process. But she very soon reassured me.</p>

<p>“I worked hard then, and I had no worries. But I have
known plenty of care since then. I suppose you came to see
my husband, sir. Is there any business I can do? He started
for his holiday this morning. The doctor has been ordering him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
change of air; and at last I persuaded him to go. He is gone for
a month or so, to Southsea. We have a daughter there doing
very well indeed. She is married to a large boat-builder.
My eldest son George sees to everything here, now his father
has taken him partner. But I keep the books, and can take
any order, just as if Mr. Moggs was at home.”</p>

<p>It seemed rather strange that she should speak like this,
quite as if she expected some inquiry. I looked at my uncle
and saw that the same idea was passing through his mind.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Moggs,” he said, as if he wanted time to
think; “I fear that we must not trouble you. But are you
in the habit of entering orders?”</p>

<p>“All the more important ones we do. At least for the
last year or two we have. It was through a curious thing
that happened, and we were nearly getting into trouble.”</p>

<p>“You cannot be expected to show your books to strangers.
I wanted to ask one little question. Moggs would have answered
it with pleasure. But of course, as he is not at home—”</p>

<p>“That need not make any difference, sir. Everything we
do is plain and open. We don’t make a practice of showing
our books. But if there is any particular entry you wish to
inquire about, I shall be glad to help you. That is, if you can
tell me the right date.”</p>

<p>Again we were surprised at her alacrity. But after a few
words, my uncle mentioned the 15th of last May, as the date
of the occurrence he wished to be informed about.</p>

<p>“Let us look at the day book,” she answered very promptly;
“that will show everything we did then. It is in the next
room. You shall see it in a minute.”</p>

<p>While she was gone, my uncle leaned both hands upon his
stick, and looked at me. “This is all gammon, Kit,” he
whispered; “never mind; you watch her.”</p>

<p>The old lady soon reappeared with the book, which was
nothing but a calendar interleaved.</p>

<p>“You see I have learned business since you knew me, Mr.
Orchardson,” she said as she turned back to the date; “Moggs
isn’t half such a scholar as I am; but George is a great deal
better. Why, he can do decimals, and fractions, and all that.
You don’t mind my turning back the edge of the leaf. Our
prices, of course, are our own concern. We don’t seem to have
done much on the day you speak of.”</p>

<p>“Very little indeed. Much less than usual; though the
day, if I remember right, was beautifully clear and sunny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
There seem to have been only three boats out, and all of them
up the river. Your husband spoke of coming down our way;
but I suppose it was some other time. And of fetching a lady,
who cried all the way.”</p>

<p>“Then it must have been some other day. It could never
have been on that day, you may be certain; or here it would
be in black and white. But he never remembers when he did
a thing; and he often mixes up two years together. A lady
who cried? Why, let me see; I did hear something about it.
Was she in deep mourning, Mr. Orchardson?”</p>

<p>“Not in deep mourning at all; but a grey summer dress,
and a short cloak, or jacket, or whatever you call it, braided in
front and scolloped round the bottom. And a very beautiful
face with blue eyes, like the colour of the sky in settled weather—oh,
but she may have cried them out, so you must not go by
that, so much. And she had a pretty way of putting up one
hand—”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” I said, for who could stand all this? And Mrs.
Moggs looked at me, as if she was so sorry.</p>

<p>“Oh, then it must be some one different altogether. The
young party I heard of was about a year ago, and they did say
she was going to her father’s funeral, whether that day or the
next, I won’t be certain. My poor Moggs begins to get queer
in the head, from being so much on the water, no doubt. He
is right about most things, and you may take his word for untold
gold, Mr. Orchardson. Such a man of his word never lived, I
do believe. Sometimes I say it is unnatural, and he ought to
try to break himself; for if every one was like him, where
would business be? But without days and months, he is wrong
more than right, even when he have been to church and heard
the psalms. No, no, sir; he have put you in the wrong boat
altogether. It can’t have been any of our people.”</p>

<p>“You are sure to know best;” said my uncle, looking at
her, in a very peculiar way of his, which was apt to mean—“You
are a liar;” and she seemed to know well what was meant
by it. “Mrs. Moggs, we are much obliged to you. Remember
me to your worthy husband”—he laid a little stress on the
adjective—“as soon as he comes back from Southsea. Or
rather when you join him there. What station do you find
most convenient?”</p>

<p>“Woking, sir; there are others nearer. But that is the
first where all trains stop, without you go back to Surbiton. ’Tis
a long drive to Woking; but they will soon come nearer, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to what I hear of it. How they do cut up the country, to
be sure! They are talking of a lot of cross-lines already. But
the river is the true line, made by the Lord, and ever so much
more pleasant.”</p>

<p>“So it is, Mrs. Moggs; and quite fast enough for me,
when it isn’t frozen over, as it was last winter. Ah, you must
have had a bad time then! But I am glad to have found you
so flourishing. Good-bye, and we are very much obliged
to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the liar!” he cried, as we shot out of hearing. “Put
a beggar on horseback—it is the truest saying. Here comes a
boat of theirs, by the colour! Hold hard a moment, Kit; I
want to ask a question.”</p>

<p>Easing oars, we glided gently past a light boat fitted for
double sculling, with only one young fellow in it, perhaps an
apprentice.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said my uncle; “we want to know the name
of your best doctor here in Shepperton. Your governor is an
old friend of mine. What’s the name of the one he goes to?”</p>

<p>“He!” cried the young fellow, balancing his sculls; “he
never been to no doctor in his life. Don’t look as if he
wanted one, do he? Oh, I wish I was as tough as the old
bloke is.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, Kit? Pretty solid, don’t you
think? What a bushel of lies we have had from that old
Emmy! ‘Jemmy’ she was called, till she turned out a girl,
and then they took the J off. Such things don’t happen
in these schooling days; and much good they have done with
them! That thief of a Moggs has cut away, you see, through
what he heard last night in Sunbury. They’d lynch him
there, if they knew he had a fist in it. Now one thing is quite
clear to me. Your dear Kitty was taken in a boat, to
Shepperton, or somewhere up the river; and Moggs was paid
well for doing it, and to hold his tongue about it afterwards.
Most likely he did not bring the <i>Duchess</i>, but a lighter and
swifter boat, perhaps the one we met. It is useless to ask any
of his fellows; you may be sure he never let them know of it.
And it would have been dark by the time he took her. He
spoke of an old man, you told me, when he let out what has
put us up to this. Could that Downy have made himself into
an old man?”</p>

<p>“He could make himself into almost anything; but never
so completely as to cheat my Kitty. It must have been some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
one he sent, and not himself. She would never have gone with
the scoundrel himself.”</p>

<p>“No, she was much too sharp for that. What lies can
they have told, to make her cry so? It is the d——dest plot I
ever heard, or read of. And not a word from her, all this time!
if she had been alive, she would have found a way to write.
Whatever she might believe you had done, she never would
have been so cold-blooded to her Kit. That is the darkest
point of all. I know what women are. Even her step-mother
would scarcely have been so relentless. And Kitty was the
softest of the soft to any one she cared for. I fear that you
must make up your mind to the worst that can have happened,
my dear boy.”</p>

<p>“I will do nothing of the sort,” I answered, although I had
often tried to do it; “and just when we have hit upon a fresh
track, uncle! <i>Nip</i> is in the stable. Can I have him? I shall
start for Woking Road, this very afternoon. It can do no harm,
if it does no good. And I never could sit still, and let it stop
just as it is.”</p>

<p>“Very well; and I will telegraph for Tony Tonks to come
down by the time that you return. We are bound to let
him know of this last turn of the mystery.”</p>

<p>To this I agreed; and as soon as we got back, I saddled the
young horse <i>Nip</i>, and rode by way of Walton Bridge to Woking,
feeling as I went that I would almost rather know the worst,
than live on in this horrible suspense.</p>

<p>Woking Road Station was a very different place from what
it is now, and of much less importance. Where a busy town
stands now, created by the railway, and mainly peopled by it,
there were in those days but a few sad cottages in an expanse
of dark furze and lonely commons. Very poor sandy land,
and black patches where the gorse had been fired, and one
public-house, called of course the <i>Railway Hotel</i>, and large
sweeps of young fir-plantations were its chief features then, and
the shabby station looked like a trunk pitched from the line.</p>

<p>There were two dirty flies, like watchmen’s boxes, one with
the shafts turned up, and the other peopled by a horse, who
had been down upon his knees, and was licking the flies off at
his leisure. The driver was sitting on a log in the distance,
cutting bread and cheese, and sipping something from a tin
which appeared to have submitted to the black embrace of
bonfires.</p>

<p>Perceiving that this was a crusty old fellow, of true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
British fibre, and paid by the day, which relieved him from
restless anxiety for work, I approached him as nearly as I could
in his own vein.</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to be very busy here just now. But I
suppose your old nag can go along when he likes. How much
do you charge to Shepperton?”</p>

<p>“Shepp’ton, Shepp’ton? Never heard of no such place.
Which way do it lie, governor?</p>

<p>“Well, you had better ask,” I said very craftily as I fancied;
“some of your mates will be sure to know. Some of them
must have been there before now. They can tell you how far
it is.”</p>

<p>“None of them at home this afternoon,” the lazy rogue
answered, as he took another mouthful; “better ask station-master.
Like enough, he knows.”</p>

<p>“He has nothing to do with you. And I want to know
what the fare is. Look here, I’ll stand you a pint at the bar,
if you will just come up, and find out what it is. Some of
your mates must have been as far as that, to take people for the
pike-fishing. Shepperton is a great place for that.”</p>

<p>“Very well, come along. But what do you want a cab for,
when you’ve got your own horse, and a good ’un too?”</p>

<p>“Stick to your own business,” I answered gruffly; and that
tone seemed to have more charm for him, as happens very often
with ill-conditioned men; “you are on your legs now, try to
keep them moving.”</p>

<p>“Gent wants to know fare to Shepperton;” he shouted
through the precincts of the bar into the stable-yard. “Any
of you chaps been there lately? Governor gone up to have a
snooze.” He illustrated that point with a genial wink.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom been there, not so very long agone,” said a
little old man who was washing a double curb under the
pump, and twisting out the grime with his thumbnails; “or if it
wasn’t Tom, it was Joe—Joe Clipson, so it was. And a long
job it were. I had to stop up for him. Thought something
must have happened—he were gone such a time.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but perhaps he went with a fishing party,” I said as
indifferently as I could; “when people go fishing they won’t be
hurried. Come in and have a glass of beer yourself, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Well, no. I never see’d no rods, nor baskets, nor nothing
of that sort, so far as I remember. But he did say something
about waiting for a boat. Thank’e, sir, thank’e; here’s your
good health.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“How long ago was it? And who went with him?” My
hand began to shake a little, do what I would. For I seemed
to be on the track at last, where no one was likely to be bribed
into lying.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know justly, for I worn’t here when he
went; and when he come back, he had been to station first,
and I were that sleepy that I didn’t care to hearken, nor he to
gab much, for that matter; but I know he said something
about a young femmel. And how long agone? Why, let me
see. Must ’a been about time for sowing scarlet-runners, for I
mind my little grand-darter was playing with them, pointing
out the speckles, and no two quite alike, a thing as I never
took no heed on; and I must a’ been shelling of them for her
mother.”</p>

<p>“What time do you generally sow scarlet-runners here?
Not, I suppose, till all chance of frost is over.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, generally about third week in May month.
There is a lucky day, I know—birthday of Saint Somebody.
Rabbit me if I can tell his name—the chap as took the Devil
by the nose and made him holler. Blest if I shouldn’t ’a
liked to see that though. Wouldn’t you, Bill? What a
spree it must ’a been!”</p>

<p>“I can’t remember anything about those saints. Our
parson isn’t one to insist upon them. But the one that did
that, was called ‘Dunstan,’ I believe. ‘Dunstan,’ does that
sound like it?”</p>

<p>“Why, it is the very ticket!” he exclaimed, with a clink
of his pewter on the slate slab, made up to look like marble.
“Bill, you know, that’s the day for putting scarlet-runners in?”</p>

<p>“Was it him as was going in a cab, to what you call it?”</p>

<p>“No, no, Bill. You never had no eddication. They used
to teach us better in the times gone by. ’Twas three, or four
days before his time. Fetch a Prayer-book, miss; and then
I’ll prove it.”</p>

<p>The young lady in the bar, who had been looking at us
queerly, tossed her head, as if to say—“What fools these men
are!” Then she swept the money out of reach, and disappeared.
Presently she came back, with an ancient Prayer-book; and
my old friend, after spitting on his fingers, turned over the
leaves of the calendar, and shouted—“Here it is! I could
’a sworn to it, from Sunday-school. May 19th. St. Dunstan’s
Day!”</p>

<p>He put his thumb upon the place, and made a long-abiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
mark; and I never shall forget again St. Dunstan’s Day.
Those Board schools never teach such useful things as that.
And at grammar-school we only kept the best of the Apostles.</p>

<p>“Where is Joe Clipson to be found?” I asked. “Surely
he could tell us all about it. I will give a sovereign to know
who came in his cab, that night, from Shepperton.”</p>

<p>All who had gathered for that great discussion looked at me
with astonishment and fear. And I saw that I had made a
wrong move altogether. For nothing shuts up country mouths
so sharply, as the hovering in the air of a thing that may prove
criminal. At the same time, I saw that deep interest was
stirred; and I fancied, very naturally, that it must be in my
favour.</p>

<p>“Can’t say when Joe will be at home,” said my old friend.
“He have gone to Knapp Hill with a gent, to see the trees.
When they gets among they, they never comes back in a hurry.
Might be nine o’clock afore he comes home.”</p>

<p>I looked at my watch, and saw that I must start at once, if
I meant to be at home in time to meet Tony Tonks. And it
struck me, that he would be much more capable of going
through with the inquiries here, than I, who had already made
a muddle of it, by putting questions too point-blank. So I
tried to put on a careless manner.</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t say any more about it now. Only I
should like to know what fish they caught; or whether they
weighed in at the club with what they bought. If we think
it worth while to go on with this, we can send a boy over, to
hear Joe’s account. It doesn’t concern any one except ourselves.
But we don’t like to be beaten by the silver hook. There is a
rare fish at Shepperton, that nobody can catch.”</p>

<p>They looked at me, as if they could not quite accept this
turn; and there was much disappointment on the barmaid’s
face; for, with a woman’s instinct, she had scented a romance.
But without another word, I jumped into the saddle, and was
soon upon the furzy commons, full of prickly wonderings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER L.<br />

<small>A POCKETFUL OF MONEY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">We</span> are on the straight road now,” said Tonks, as soon as he
had heard my story; “and jigger me if we don’t hunt her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
down. But luck can give five stone to skill, whether the
course be straight or round. I have done all I know; but you
beat me in a canter, just by getting the inside turn. But
unless I am out of it altogether, you may trust me to fetch up
by-and-by. I must find out who that old chap was. It could
not be Downy himself, you think. Not likely that she would
have gone with him. Well, now you want to hear what I have
done; and I think it leads to something.</p>

<p>“I am bound to be terrible leary, you see, for he is
uncommon wide-awake. If he had spent all his life in the
sharpest stables, he could hardly have been more up to snuff.
He never believes a single word a fellow says, until he has
been round it to know the reason. I can’t abide that sort of
thing myself, for it gives such a lot of trouble on both sides.
If he asked you what o’clock it was, and you looked at your
watch and told him, he’d place no faith in it, unless he saw
the hands; and even then he would doubt whether you had
not shifted them, on purpose to mislead him.”</p>

<p>“Such a rogue should be knocked on the head,” said my
uncle; “and I wish I had the doing of it.”</p>

<p>“It makes everybody hate him, although his manner is not
rough. He never seems to think it worth his while to take
offence at people. But they would rather have that, than what
he does. Old Pots is popular compared to him; because Pots
hates his enemies. But this man goes on as if they were not
worth hating. And that has made me doubt sometimes why he
has done this; and sometimes whether he has done it at all.”</p>

<p>“If he has not done it, it can only be the Devil,” my
uncle broke in with some anger; “I am not superstitious, but
the Devil might be vexed by Professor Fairthorn’s kick-me-jigs,
and run off with his daughter, just to dig him in the ribs. By
George, I never thought of that before!”</p>

<p>“And I hope you won’t think of it again,” I said, in great
haste that the idea might not go into his mind, for it would be
hard work to get it out again; “I should hope you know better,
Uncle Corny! Would the Devil think of paying such a price
as Phil Moggs gets, and hire a four-wheeler to Woking Road
Station?”</p>

<p>“You are right, Kit. He will have full value for his
money; and he never could have stood the smoke I made.
He gets too much of that at home. But Tonks says now that
he doubts if Bulwrag did it. What are we coming to? Are
we all to start again, as if we had never spent twopence over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
it? Tonks has been with him a deal too much. When two
fellows get together so, they can’t smell one another.”</p>

<p>“I judge just the same as if I never saw him. He isn’t
one to get over a fellow with his looks, nor his manner neither.
Mr. Orchardson, you are quite wrong there. I go by observation,
and nothing else.”</p>

<p>“And what has come of your observations?” My uncle
still despised Mr. Tonks, and he hated to be told that he was
wrong, especially when I heard it.</p>

<p>“A good deal,” said Tonks, leaning back in his chair and
collecting his ideas; “a good deal, if you place confidence in
me; without which I act for nobody. I don’t pretend to be
any wonder. But when I take a man’s money, I am true to
him. I have plenty of other jobs I can take to. Throw me
over, if you choose, and have done it.”</p>

<p>“No, Tony Tonks, we will not do that. I believe that you
are doing all you know; and I am a reasonable man. Now
tell us all that you have to tell.”</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t very much, but it may come to something
more, especially with what you have just found out.
The worst of it is that he is getting shy of me, and I dare not
say things as I did. I told him that I wanted to run down,
to take stock of Henderson’s place down here, and I asked him
if he knew the neighbourhood, and whether we should
take a trap and run down together. If I could get him
to that, I might pick up a lot of things, in a careless and
casual way, you know. But he was much too fly for any
game of that sort; and it almost seemed to me as if he
smelled a rat. Then I got on to him about the scientific
codgers, thinking to lead up to the old Professor and the
cruise he is going on about the bottom of the sea, and the
place for laying cables, and a lot of things like that. But
that wouldn’t serve; and so I tried another lay. We were
talking of old Pots, and I said, ‘Oh, by-the-bye, was it true
that the old fool was sweet upon some girl, some girl with
a lot of money, who pitched him over?’ And he said,
‘What a joke! I should like to hear of that. Tell us the story,
Bowles, if you know it.’ Bowles is the name he knows
me by, you see; for it would not do for me to turn up as
Tonks.</p>

<p>“In fact I got no hold upon him, as I thought I should have
done; for he knows how to make people useful and no more;
and I saw that he would drop me as soon as he had learned all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the little useful things I know at cards and pool. Of course I
was not swell enough for him to introduce me to his ‘family
circle,’ as the ladies call it. And as for getting him to take a
drop too much, and then working him skilfully, as can be done
with most fellows,—well, I am pretty tough, but if I took the
water and he the brandy, I believe I should be drunk before he
was. His head is too big for any barrel to upset it.</p>

<p>“I was pretty near despairing, I can tell you, Mr. Orchardson,
though I never have been beaten yet, and don’t want to
begin it; when a little bit of accident, the merest casual accident,
put me further forward than a month of work might do.
You may be pretty sure, without my saying, that my appearance
is not distinguished enough—although I have gone arm in arm
with bigger nobs than he is, and real gentlemen some of them—but
not swell enough to be seen in Downy Bulwrag’s company,
in Piccadilly, or the Park, or high and mighty places.
No no, not for Joe, as the poet quotes it.</p>

<p>“But he is not at all above allowing me the honour of his
society, when I can be of service to him, and no one is likely to
say—‘Who’s that?’ And there is one particular house of his—never
mind where, that has nothing to do with it—at which
he always likes to have me, and treats me quite as his honoured
friend. And there we were on Monday night, tickling the
pigeons, as you might say, which is only what they expect of us.
He can beat me now in my own inventions, not from any
superior skill, but because he is the coolest hand ever seen, and
nothing puts him out of tune.</p>

<p>“He had won all along the board that night, and his pockets
were full of money; but instead of being up, as a decent
fellow would be, he took all his luck in a cold-blooded way,
just as if it were nothing to what he deserved. That is never
the right way to get any more. You must never do that, Mr.
Orchardson.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I never gamble; and I want no lesson.” My uncle
spoke severely; he thought it due to me to do so.</p>

<p>“It is too late in life for you to begin,” Tonks proceeded
affably; “and your hands are too hard, Mr. Orchardson. But
as I was saying, we came down the stairs, and slipped out very
quietly. It was one of those little streets off Soho, where a
man who knows London like the lines of his own hand may
lose himself in half a minute, by one wrong turning. The night
was very dark, and all the publics shut up long ago, and not a
light was to be seen, except a dull lamp here and there. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
we were quite used to this sort of thing, and felt no sort of
fear, though we knew that we were passing through a den of
robbers; and a man who has a lot of money in his pockets is
inclined to fancy somehow that every stranger knows it.</p>

<p>“Suddenly, as we went by a narrow reeking archway, a
fellow sprang out of it immediately behind us. Before I could
turn, I heard a crash, and there he lay, sent backward by a
heavy blow from Bulwrag’s fist. I thought that he was killed,
for the blow had been tremendous; such as I have seen, when
they meant business in the prize-ring. But luckily for him,
the fellow wore a hard-rimmed hat, which lay behind him
doubled up, while he rolled over, gasping.</p>

<p>“‘Not much got out of that,’ said Downy, looking at his
knuckles; ‘the sooner we slope the better, Bowles; or there
will be a rumpus.’</p>

<p>“‘We can’t go, before we see whether you have killed him.
You hit him hard enough to kill an ox,’ I answered.</p>

<p>“‘Killed myself more likely. Just look at my hand. The
fellow can’t be hurt much. What had he on his hat-front?
Don’t pick him up. He’ll be better where he is.’</p>

<p>“But seeing no one up or down the street, I disobeyed him,
and drew the stunned man into the shadow of the archway, and
set him with his head against the bricks, while Bulwrag showed
much more concern about his hat.</p>

<p>“‘Here it is—a metal thing! I shall keep it. Put his
hat on again, Bowles; and let him meditate. We don’t want
to cut a shine at Bow Street. Let’s be off!’</p>

<p>“I was rising to go, for I hate the police-courts, and the
man was evidently coming round, and could do very well
without us. But before we could leave him, he stretched out
his hand, and said, ‘Captain, Captain, for God’s sake stop a
minute. I have got something for you most important. I
didn’t go to rob you, but to tell you something.’</p>

<p>“You may be sure that I was pretty wide awake at this;
but of course I took care not to show it. And I saw by a
shadow on the line of wall that Bulwrag had raised one hand,
probably to his lips.</p>

<p>“‘Right!’ said the man, who was on his legs now, but
sidled away into a darker place; ‘let the other gent go. I
was to tell you by yourself. I daren’t come to your place, but
you must come to mine.’</p>

<p>“‘Out with it! I never keep any secrets,’ Bulwrag replied,
just to humbug me. ‘Unless it concerns other people, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
then—Well perhaps, Bowles, you wouldn’t mind going to your
den. Stop, let me speak to you a moment outside.’</p>

<p>“He took me away, while the man stopped there; and I
saw that his object was to prevent me from finding out any
more about that fellow. I was forced to let him have his way
that far, and to play a waiting game with him.</p>

<p>“‘Some bosh or other,’ he whispered roughly; ‘I think I
know who the fellow is, and all about it. A gamekeeper’s
daughter down in Hampshire—always wanting money. Stop,
you may as well take most of this, for fear of my being too
soft-hearted. There, leave me five; that’s as much as I can
spare. Good-night! Very much obliged. See you to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“‘You had better mind what you are about,’ I said; ‘he
owes you a grudge, and you are in a slummy part, you know.
I’ll come with you, if you like, and wait outside.’</p>

<p>“‘You had better not wait at all. I am apt to mistake
people, as you have seen already?’</p>

<p>“This was a threat; and as such I took it, walking off
with a dignity which must have vexed him. However, as soon
as I was round the corner, I slipped a pair of rubber socks,
that I always carry with me, over my boots, and put myself on
duty in other ways; so that if he met me in the shadow, or
even ten yards from a lamp, he would have little chance of
knowing me. And in less than two minutes I was back again;
not in the archway, of course, but at a place from which I
could make out part of what was going on there. For I knew
that there was something up quite out of the common way with
him. Now how did I know that? Can either of you tell
me?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, by his knocking that fellow down,” my
uncle replied sagaciously; “that was a bit of by-play, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Not it. That was all done, bone fiddles—as we say. I
knew it by the pile of cash he gave me to hold for him. Oh,
he is a deep file, and all there at any moment. He had clearly
formed a low opinion of your humble servant, and thought
that I should bolt with all the rhino, and be seen no more.
And it could be no trifle that made him risk the sum of five
and forty pounds.”</p>

<p>“Forty-five pounds!” I exclaimed; “how strange! Why
that was the very sum”—But here I stopped, for I did not
wish to go into that question with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, forty-five pounds, when I came to count it. I could
not tell how much it was, at the moment; but I felt that it
was a tidy lump of cash, and I jumped at his motive in handing
it to me. But he reckoned altogether without his host there.
Well, when I came back, there they were, still at it. I could
not hear a word of what they said, for I was forced to keep my
distance. But I guessed that the skunk would take him somewhere,
for what he had said beforehand, and then my wits
would come into play. And sure enough he did, for in about
two minutes they both came out, and looked up and down the
street, to make sure that they were not followed. Seeing no
one, they set off, at a good quick step, and I took the right
style to be after them.</p>

<p>“They turned so many corners, and went through so many
alleys, that no other man in the world could have kept them
in sight, as I did, without blundering on them. We passed
through many places I knew nothing of; but at last I stowed
them in a quiet little den, not very far from Drury Lane.
Here the fellow went down a steep narrow staircase, and
knocked at a door that was like a cellar-flap. Downy stopped
outside; which I thought was very wise of him, while the
other went in, and for some time disappeared. But Downy
came back to the entrance for fresh air, or perhaps to be certain
that he was not watched. And I gave myself up for lost; but
most luckily an empty truck or barrow stood against the wall,
and I just slipped under it in time. I could have touched him
with my hand, but the place was very dark; and he went back
without twigging me.</p>

<p>“I have had many narrow shaves, but none to beat that.
He would have killed me with a blow, and in a hole like that,
I should soon have been under the flagstones. I had no time
to be in a funk till it was over; but then I began to shiver
horribly, and my nerves were not fit to be trusted any more.</p>

<p>“I knew this; and thinking of it made them worse, for
I have a wife and seven children to look after. All I cared for
now was to get away, for I had run the chap to earth, and
could put my hand upon him.</p>

<p>“There was no chance of overhearing any of their talk,
even if they had any; and if they once discovered me, even
though I might escape, there would be no chance of learning
more. I could find the hole again, for I had seen ‘Coke
Yard’ daubed with a tar-brush on a patch of whitewash, and
wherever I have once been I can always go again. So when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Bulwrag turned back towards the door, I made ready to slip
round the corner.</p>

<p>“But before I could do so, I heard the door creak, and the
fellow with the broken hat came out again. I heard him say—‘Now,
you’ll believe me, Captain. I’d be glad of the price
of a new hat, afore you go.’ What it was he gave to Downy,
I could hardly see, but it looked like a packet of papers, or
letters, or something done up in paper. Downy gave him
something, and he said—‘That all? Ain’t much for such
news;’ and then Downy gave him more. ‘Daren’t come to
your place. You come here,’ he says, ‘if you want any more—say
next Saturday night; ask for Migwell Bengoose, and
say <i>Cluck</i>.’ That was the name so far as I could catch it.
But I was bound to be off, for Bulwrag was coming. And you
may depend upon it that I did not stop to chat with him.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER LI.<br />

<small>NOT IN A HURRY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> were all pretty sure that this discovery of Tony’s concerned
us deeply, and might lead to something, if followed up at once
with luck and skill. But we thought it more important that
he should go first to Woking Road, and inquire further into
the story of Joe Clipson’s cab, which he was sure to do much
better than myself; for he could make himself look like a
brother cabman, without any trouble.</p>

<p>He had little more to tell us about the Coke Yard yet, for
he had to feel his way very tenderly there, and must wait for
opportunities. And Bulwrag (who was never very sweet of
temper, though, unlike his mother, he could curb himself) had
been more like a bear than a cultivated Christian, since he
got that cut across his knuckles. As our sympathies were not
with the sufferer, Tony made us laugh by his description of the
want of resignation in a case so trifling.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” cried Bulwrag, after hopping round the room,
as soon as his poultice began to draw; “look at this scurvy
Saint! He is made of copper. Why the devil couldn’t he
have a Saint made of gold?”</p>

<p>Tonks replied that perhaps the individual with the hat
could not afford a golden Saint to sit upon the brim; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
copper perhaps had done him a much better turn than gold,
both in saving his head from the crushing blow, and avenging
it on the smiter. For the wound looked very angry, and it
might be even dangerous. But what made him wear such a
Saint at all?</p>

<p>“How the deuce can I tell why they wear such rubbish?”
Bulwrag had answered crustily. “Those foreign sailors are
such fools. You know more about him than I do.”</p>

<p>This was by no means true as yet, though Tonks hoped to
make it so, if allowed his own time about it. And he told us
quite earnestly, and as I believe sincerely, that he never had
felt, not his mind alone, but his heart, more deeply engaged in
solving the merits of the darkest horse in the leariest stable, than
they both were now in getting to the very bottom of this affair
about my Kitty. And though I did not altogether like his
way of putting it, when the meaning is good we must not
quarrel with the manner in which other people look at things.</p>

<p>So we treated him well and put him up for the night; and
the following morning I drove him by way of Weybridge to
Woking Road Station, or as near thereto as we could get
without any one observing us. Then I went back to Weybridge,
so as to meet him at that station, and hear all he had to
say, before he took another train for London.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been better managed. I borrowed a
badge from Sims the flyman, and a spotted yellow neckerchief,
and a broken whip, and Tony lounged into the inn-yard, as if
he had left his cab down at the blacksmith’s by the bridge.
As I saw him in the distance I said to myself that nature must
have meant him for the driver of a cab, for he put his knee out
and turned his heels in, and carried his elbows, as if he had
been born so. Any brotherhood of good will and lofty feeling,
such as that of cabmen essentially is, must welcome him at
once, and make him free of any knowledge it possessed that
would bring in nothing.</p>

<p>And so it proved, when he rejoined me by the two o’clock
train at Weybridge. “What have you ordered?” he asked; and
I replied,—</p>

<p>“Chump chops, new potatoes, and pickled onions.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better,” he was good enough to say; “but
have in the pewter first. Blest if I believe there’s anything to
parch the throat like a jolly good lie, and if I’ve told one, I’ve
told fifty. Dinner first, business afterwards.”</p>

<p>That I should consent to this will show how thoroughly I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
had been drilled by long endurance and fretful discipline.
Perpetual disappointment too, and the habit which hope had
now acquired of falling without a blow—just like an over-matched
prize-fighter—as well as a sense of evil fortune, drove
me sometimes almost into the apathy of a fatalist. And so I
let Tony Tonks munch on, and even joined him in that
process.</p>

<p>“I wish I had got that to do again,” he said, as at last he
laid down knife and fork; “I don’t often do so well as that.
The air of these commons is uncommon sharp, sharper even
than the Heath is. But you have been very patient, and I
won’t keep you any longer. I found out all they knew back
there, and it only cost a shilling. I don’t know that it is
worth much more; for it carries us very little further. But so
far as it goes, it is plain enough. I had it from Joe Clipson,
the man who drove them; and no secret was made of the affair
to him.”</p>

<p>Now the story, as he had it, comes to this. Some one got
out at Woking Road Station, on the afternoon of May 15th,
it might have been an up or it might have been a down train,
Clipson could not say, for two trains came in together, and the
man had no luggage of any sort. The date could be fixed by
several things, and there could not be any doubt about it.
And the time when two trains meet there in the afternoon is
4.15; which comes pretty close to our figures.</p>

<p>This man carried nothing but a little bag, a little black
leather bag, such as nine people out of ten have. There were
three cabs, or flies as they called them there, waiting in the
station yard; for it is their busiest time of the day, and he
chose Clipson’s, because the horse looked freshest, and told
him to drive to Shepperton, without saying a word about the
fare.</p>

<p>Clipson had not been in that part long, and he had
scarcely heard of Shepperton, which is severed from all those
Surrey places by the unbridged river. But it seemed to him
a pleasant thing to start without any fettering as to money, and
the man who engaged him seemed very free of that, in a style
that said—“Never stand out for a shilling.” And he seems
to have acted up to this; although it is scarcely ever done,
except with a true friend’s money. But Clipson did not care
whose it was, if he might be allowed to go home with it.</p>

<p>The day was very bright and pleasant—exactly as I remembered
it—with plenty of light in the air, but no heat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
no flies to make horses grieve that they cannot swear. Clipson
remembered how cold it grew, even before the sun went down,
and he tucked a sack under his calves as he came home, because
he had promised Mrs. Clipson so, and his word was more
tender in absence.</p>

<p>He said that his fare seemed to know a good bit about the
principles of the road—that was the word he used for it—as if
he had learned it from a map, or description which somebody
had rubbed into him. But he was not in any way up to the
corners, which show—as Joe said, and with some reason too—whether
a man understands what he is at properly. But he
knew where he was at Chertsey Bridge, and he waved his
hand at the first turn to the right.</p>

<p>Being a Surrey man, from some outlandish part in that
straggling country, Clipson was not at all comfortable upon
our side of the river. To a certain extent, and with much better
reason, I feel the same thing as regards them; though I admit
(without thinking twice about it) that there are plenty of good
people there, and especially my Aunt Parslow. But Clipson,
although he depended for his livelihood upon a railway
station, did not like going into unknown places, especially with
a horse who might come down and stop there; for there was
only one sound knee out of sixteen that were washed in the
yard every Saturday; but that one belonged to Clipson.</p>

<p>His horse was a clipper, by his own account; and nobody
could tell how good he was, because he never had been called
upon to do his best. Still it was a toughish journey for him;
and Mr. Clipson could not see, taking the state of the roads
into account, and the distance, and the waiting, how he could
charge less than five and twenty shillings; and if asked to go
again he would not do it for the money. For he waited four
hours, as he vowed, and I daresay it may have been three, at
the public-house, which is a sharp pull from the house of Phil
Moggs at the waterside.</p>

<p>For these details I did not care so much (although they were
full of interest) as I cared to know who the man was that
employed him, and how he behaved, and whether he looked
good, and above all how my darling Kitty seemed to take
things, and what she said, and whether she was weeping all
the way about myself. The cabman had paid no attention at
all to this part of the question, and could give no more
account of Kitty, than if she had been a portmanteau, or
inside one. Tony Tonks had never asked (as a man of kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
nature would have done) whether my dear had a handkerchief
in her hand, or whether she seemed to gulp down a sob, or
how she looked up at the evening-star, or even what the
condition of her eyes was! For him it was quite enough to
learn, that the “young ’ooman looked down in the mouth
like.” Well, that is the way the world goes on.</p>

<p>About that I cared to make no fuss; for it even seemed
a pleasure to me that none but myself should know these
things; remembering as I did, that no one ever could cry as
my Kitty could. For I never could understand how it was,
that having so very little practice as she had (in spite of
many opportunities), she could yet make anybody feel as if
all the world was woe, the moment there appeared a gleam of
trouble in her soft eyes. I am tolerably hard, and Uncle Corny
harder still—from having lived so much longer—but either of
us would rather have had a 64lb. box of strawberries drop from
the tail of the van upon the tender places of both feet, than
let a single word fall from us, even in the hottest moment, to
bring a cloud into those tender eyes. However, all people are
not like us; and perhaps she never let that cabman see
what was the matter with her; for she was proud, as well as
gentle.</p>

<p>Moreover the man was hungry, and that makes a world
of difference. The kindest man that was ever born cannot be
expected fairly to feel for his fellow-creatures, when he is
yearning after animals. The heart being full of beef and
mutton, because there are none in the stomach, how can any
room be left for creatures of less relish? This explanation may
be unsound; but at any rate the cabman did not melt at
Kitty’s weeping.</p>

<p>And now two questions of prime importance rose in following
out this tale. It was evident from two accounts, both that
of Moggs the boatman and of Clipson the cab-driver, that no
kind of compulsion had been used to make Kitty go with them.
It was plain that she went of her own accord, deeply grieved—as
the boatman’s story showed—but resigned and patient. In
the first place, then, who was the man that had done all this to
fetch her? And again, when they got to Woking Station,
whither did they journey thence?</p>

<p>As to the first point Tony Tonks had found out little
more than I did. The cabman said that he believed he would
know the gent again if he saw him, but there was nothing
very particular about him to notice. He seemed to be elderly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
and rather short, but very sharp and active. His clothes were
dark, and he wore a short cloak, not much longer than a
policeman’s cape. He did not sit at the young lady’s side, but
on the front seat opposite to her, and he did not seem to be talking
to her much. It was quite dark when they left Shepperton,
and it must have been ten o’clock when they arrived, or later;
for the horse was a little lame from standing still so long.
They did not seem to be in any hurry, and as they had no
luggage, except a couple of light bags, he did not follow them
on to the platform, and could not pretend to say which way
they went, for there were three more down-trains after that,
and four or it might be five to London.</p>

<p>As to that, Tonks had made vain inquiries of the station-porters,
and booking clerks. It was so long ago by this time,
that even those who might have noticed them had forgotten.
They had passed into the station, that was very well established;
but after that nothing at all could be discovered, and there the
clue broke hopelessly.</p>

<p>After hearing all these things, I became sadly downcast.
They reminded me of that dreadful night when the snowdrifts
overwhelmed me. I seemed to be walking in the same sort of
maze, continually struggling to get forward, and perpetually
driven back, seeming to walk with all my might, yet by a stronger
power to stand still. And losing all confidence in myself, I
asked Tony Tonks what he thought of it, just as if he had been
the great oracle that smelled the turtle soup of Crœsus, without
even longing for a taste of it.</p>

<p>“It all turns out just according to my views,” replied Tonks,
as if he saw his views running like the gravy, which he had been
saving up to drink out of the spoon; “the same as I have expressed
all along, and find them confirmed more by all I discover.
Any one who puts two and two together could swear
that Downy Bulwrag is at the bottom of the mischief, though
he has taken uncommonly good care not to show his nose in it.
I am rather inclined to think that the lady is on the Continent.
They are more likely to have gone down the line than up. If
they had meant to go to town, what should have taken them to
Woking? Supposing they were shy of the Windsor line,
Surbiton would have been their place, or Weybridge. Though
of course they might have thought Woking road safer, so that
we must not reason too much by that. By the way, can the
lady speak French at all? That might make a difference to
her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not at all sure,” I replied after thinking; “for we
never happened to talk of that. She was at a good school for
a little time; and then that hateful woman, her stepmother,
took her away when she was doing well, and sent her to a
wretched place at £20 a year. She can read French, I know,
because I asked her something; but I doubt whether she can
speak it.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s where she is. I begin to smell a rat. He
took her from Southampton, depend upon it. And now I twig
some bit of meaning in that copper saint. The south of France—that’s
where she is.”</p>

<p>“But why in the south of France, more than any other
part?” I thought that he was jumping rather fast to his conclusions.</p>

<p>“Well, it might be Italy, or Spain,” he answered, with a
fine generosity; “I can’t say very much about it. But a
brother of mine was at sea, till he was drowned, and he traded
a good deal from the south of France; and he had one of those
things in his hat, because of being struck by lightning. They
get it very bad in those waters, he declared; but I can’t call to
mind the name of the saint that stops it. Of course I have no
faith in such stuff, though there might be nothing to laugh at,
after all I have seen about horses. But there it is. They stick
those things up, as an officer’s coachman mounts a cockade; and
bad luck it was for Master Downy’s knuckles. His hand was
like a pease-pudding yesterday. His flesh is always of a yellow
nature, like a Cochin China’s. Shouldn’t wonder a bit, if he
got lockjaw.”</p>

<p>“Not till I have settled with him.” It made me forget the
Rev. Peter, and all his style of regarding things, when people
spoke as if right and wrong had an equal claim upon the Lord
in heaven.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LII.<br />

<small>A WANDERING GLEAM.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> uncle, however, was not like that. He had suffered too
largely from rogues himself, in the neighbourhood of Covent
Garden, to have any calm way of considering them.</p>

<p>“Either a man is honest through and through, or else he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
a thief all over. It is humbug to talk as if a fellow didn’t
know when he is stealing, or when he is not. He knows it
pretty sharp when it is done to him; and he puts it short, as
he has a right to do. And then he turns the corner, and he
wipes his mouth, and serves others with the dose that made
him sputter. To cheat the man that cheated you, is Christian
enough; but not to pass it on to other people. Ask Mr.
Golightly what he thinks about it.”</p>

<p>That pious clergyman would scarcely have been satisfied
even with my uncle’s view of Christian conduct, although he
was moderate in his expectations of us, after all his experience
of our doings. This made it very pleasant to be with him
frequently; and for my part I am certain that I never could
have lasted through all this gloom, and suspense, and indignation,
without his example and quiet comfort. All that we had
found out, at Shepperton and at Woking, I owed to him, or at
any rate to my acquaintance with him; and although it might
not seem as yet to carry me much further, still I found some
happiness in knowing that little, and hope of learning more
from it. And now I went to him about another question,
which I could not settle for myself.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that Tabby Tapscott, who came to
attend to my uncle’s house, had more than once given me good
advice; and some may have set me down as ungrateful for
keeping her out of sight since my great disaster, as if she were
of no importance. But the real truth is, that I had sought her
counsel almost every time I saw her, and had found much
comfort from it, because she was so scornful. For the little
woman tossed her head, and shot forth her under-lip, as if she
could not trust herself to speak, so thoroughly was her mind
made up. She looked upon all that had happened as the fruits
of a foul conspiracy on the part of man against woman, and she
scarcely held me guiltless. And she had no patience with me,
because I would not do the proper thing, to find out all about
it. Until I did that, she would say no more, but leave me to
listen to a set of zanies. Why on earth I refused was more
than she could understand; and she went so far as to declare,
once or twice, that I could not be in earnest about getting
Kitty back, or I would have done it long ago. She herself had
known a girl, of Westdown parish in the North of Devon, who
found out all about her sweetheart’s murder, and got two men
hanged for committing it.</p>

<p>The means were certainly simple enough, if anything would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
come of them. The bereaved one must let the full moon pass
for as short a time as possible; and then, at twelve of the
middle-day, go to the dress last worn by the lost one, and take
something from the left side pocket, or failing that cut a piece
out. Then he might carry on as he pleased, until it came to
bed-time, and then do as follows. Under the pillow on his
left-hand side, he must place whatever he had taken from the
dress, and then instead of his common prayers, pray in the
following manner—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bring me back my love that’s gone.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bring her white, or bring her red,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">According as she is ’live or dead.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">Then he must throw the window up, or out, if it was a lattice,
and look at the moon which would then be up (for he was
supposed to keep good hours, as all gentle lovers should); and
after that he must lie down, with his left ear on the pillow,
and repeat the Doxology—which Tabby called the “Doxy”—until
it made him go to sleep. Then, as sure as he was a
living man—or in the other case a living woman—the lost
one would appear at midnight, and tell him all about it. Only
he, or she, must ask no questions, and above all offer no contradiction.</p>

<p>Now, I have never been superstitious; though some of
the wisest men I have met with seem at times to be so; and I
laughed at all this stuff of Tabby’s, although I had found her
truthful. Then I asked her to go through it all for me; but
she stared at my stupidity; “As if her would come nigh me!”
she said. “It is the love as does it, and the angels to the back
of it.”</p>

<p>But when she kept on so about it, and assured me that
much wiser people than I, and a long sight better—as she was
good enough to say—had tried this plan and been set up by it;
I began to think that it could do no harm, and if it afforded
her any pleasure—why, no one else need hear of it. Except
that the sin of witchcraft is most strongly denounced in the
Bible; and many might think that this proceeding savoured of
that character. However, if the Church of England could be
brought to sanction it, the Powers of the air might do their
worst; for our church is built upon a rock.</p>

<p>The Rev. Peter Golightly said, when I opened out this case
to him, that he was a little surprised to find me listening to
such nonsense. I told him that it was very far from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
desire to do so; but if it was likely to ease the minds of others,
it might be my duty to go on with it. At this he laughed, and
did not say, but seemed perhaps to mean it, that I was not
bound to make a fool of myself, because my brother fools
wished it. However, I was not going to be argued down about
it; and I put the question point-blank to him, whether there
was any sin in it. He could not say that there was any; but
being more on his mettle now, declared that it was rank folly,
and insisted very strongly on the superiority of prayer. There
I had him on the nail; for what was this but a mode of prayer,
invoking also those holy writers, who alone have taught us the
use of prayer? He shook his head, as if unconvinced; but his
daughter called him away just then, and I did not care to renew
the subject, feeling that now I had his permission; which he
might recall, if argued with.</p>

<p>The moon was full at six o’clock in the morning, as Uncle
Corny said; and he always knew everything about her, except
the weather she would bring. And at noon I went to my dear
wife’s frock, the one she had worn on the very day before she
disappeared from me. She had kept them on a row of hooks—for
we were not rich in wardrobes—with a scarf of something
drawn along to keep the dust from settling. It had been one
of my sorest jobs to unhang them very reverently, remembering
when she had worn them last, and how my arm had been round
them. For she had a very pretty way of coming up in the
morning (when her hair was done, and her collar on) for me to
tell her how she looked, and to see that all her strings were
right But now these empty dresses lay, all folded, and locked
in the bottom drawer.</p>

<p>I may be soft beyond most people—although it is a fault
more shared than shown—but when I had spread that simple
frock upon the bed, which I never entered now, and passing
both hands down the bosom, clumsily searched (as a man must
do) for the mouth of the little pocket, and then could only get
three fingers in—all the strength of my resolve to be quite firm
and manly quivered on my lips, and melted in the haze that
crept across my eyes. A tiny notebook, with a pencil, and a
silver thimble, a little house-wife, and a button meant to be
sewn on my coat, two or three jujubes (which she kept to pop
into my mouth, because she fancied I was hoarse sometimes)
nothing for herself, but all for me, or for my service; and then
a little scrap of paper, my last scribble from the garden—“Darling,
not till nine o’clock”—as I took them one by one, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
seemed fragrant with her sweetness, and holy from her loving
hand.</p>

<p>I could not bring myself to go through Tabby’s rigmarole
that night; for my mind was full of larger thoughts, neither
would I go upstairs into the lonely bedroom; but I gazed for
some time at the moon, as people when in sorrow do, by some
mysterious instinct. And then I placed a pillow, instead of the
roll of mat beneath my head, and under it my dear wife’s
house-wife, and her pretty thimble, not for that night only, but
as my companions henceforth; and therewith I cast myself on
the hard church-cushion, and thought of her. Before very
long, I fell asleep, having done a good day’s garden-work at
sundry jobs that were sadly in arrear.</p>

<p>But Tabby’s jingle was still in my head, moving without
my will or wish, as a mouse comes in the wainscote; and with
the moon shining into the room, one of my last reflections was
that I had been very lucky in yielding to no witchcraft. Not
that there could be anything to frighten me in my darling,
“whether white, or whether red;” by which the old chant
seemed to mean, whether she might be in the bloom of health,
or the wan hue of the winding-sheet. In either case she
would love me still; and that was the thing I cared most to
know.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I sat up and looked. The old church clock was
striking slowly, and the sleepy sound loitered on the drowsy air.
The moon was gliding calmly on her southern road, and being
in her humble summer state, she could scarcely top the big
pear-tree which stood before my window. The room was full
of light and shade, in bars, in patches, and in triangles, with
no strong contrast in and out, but fused, like silver-wire
netting, or water parted by the weir-posts, and rejoining under
them. And there, in this faint flow of light and wavering ebb
of shadow, I saw my Kitty, sitting calmly, and gazing at me
steadfastly.</p>

<p>No surprise or fear whatever crossed my mind—which seems
to show that I was not altogether wide awake; but I waited
for her to say something, while she kept on looking at me. I
had left off wearing a nightcap ever since I went to Hampton
School; not that I ever slept there, but because the boys had
laughed at it. My Uncle Corny always said that this was
tempting Providence; and now I tried to put up my hands,
but they would not go, and I sat and gazed, being a little surprised,
but not amazed, as some people might have been. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Kitty put up her hand to me, showing the palm of it quite
rosy, as it always had been; and I saw that her dress was the
one in the drawer; but that did not surprise me.</p>

<p>“Darling, you must be patient still. I am thousands of
miles away from you;” she spoke as quietly as if she were
saying—“The tea is not quite drawn yet,” and I received it as
quietly. “There is a good reason for my going; and you
know it better than I do. Only, be happy till I come back;
for whatever you feel, I feel. When I come home, we shall
never part again.”</p>

<p>This was a little too much for me, high and tragical as it
seemed.</p>

<p>“I want you now. Oh Kitty, Kitty, don’t run away again!”
I cried; and over went both my Windsor chairs, as I sprang
up, to fling my arms round her.</p>

<p>But when I came to the place where she had been, lo, there
was no one! Everything was cold and hard; instead of her
soft warm figure, all I embraced was a kitchen towel; and the
handle of a gridiron came between my vainly opened lips.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER LIII.<br />

<small>A BAD NIGHT.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Nevertheless</span>, that vision, if it was a vision, cheered me. The
more I thought of it, the more I felt that it meant something;
and though free as any man can be from human superstition,
here I found a special mercy, showing that I was not quite
abandoned and forsaken. But I took good care not to make
myself the laughing-stock of any one. Neither Uncle Corny,
nor Henderson (who was now come back from his honeymoon),
nor even Tabby Tapscott, who might well claim the best right
of all, ever heard a word of it. To Mr. Golightly alone I spoke
at all about the matter, and he, instead of laughing at me, took
it very gravely.</p>

<p>“It is meant to encourage you,” he said; “and you should
be thankful. Many even of the true believers have their doubts,
as is natural, whether our little earthly course is guided by a
higher hand; or whether in the light of full instruction we are
left to work it out. But I venture to think with the men of old,
that all things are ordered for us. You have had a bitter trial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
such as befalls very few so young; and you have borne it well,
my friend. Sometimes you have been gloomy and downcast,
but never bitter. A more mysterious affliction I have never
witnessed, and you know well how my heart is with you,
though I seldom speak of it. ‘Bear and be strong’ is the true
watchword, and you have kept it nobly. I pray that I may
live to see you in your happiness again; and you may without
presumption hold that this has been vouchsafed you, as a token
of approval, and a signal to encourage you.”</p>

<p>So I tried to take it, though it seemed but meagre comfort.
And I wished that I had broken my knees again, before I
jumped up in such haste, and spoiled the chance of learning
more. My darling seemed to have finished; but if I had only
waited, very likely she would have begun again, as women
generally do. Of geography I had little knowledge, except as
taught at a grammar-school, and then it went some three inches
down the “World as known to the ancients.” I doubted
whether the south of France could be “thousands of miles”
from Sunbury, though that might be a poetical expression, and
no lady is expected to be accurate. And what was meant by
the declaration, that I knew better than she did the reason of
her quitting me? That looked as if I had done something
wrong; and an inspired vision should have known that I had
never even glanced at any other woman. Thinking of all this,
I was puzzled, almost as much as comforted.</p>

<p>In the next thing that occurred I found a further element
of puzzle, but none at all of comfort. It was now the usual
thing for me, being in bachelor condition, to turn into my
Uncle Corny’s house, at the time he was having his early dinner.
Not that it mattered much to me; only that I was able thus
to save myself from bread and cheese, and secure a little
nourishment.</p>

<p>I was doing this to the best of my ability, without observing
it, when in came Tony Tonks, as if he was running away from the
bailiff. One of my firm convictions was that thin men never
panted; but that impression, like all others, now required
revising. Tony Tonks was in such a state, alike of mind and
body, that neither could at all work out the meaning of the
other.</p>

<p>We happened to have a little bit of boiled beef and young
carrots; and my uncle was just helping me to a scutcheon of
gristle at the corner. For he liked to keep a level cut, and he
found me fitter now than he was, for the horny places. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Tony was in such a state, that when his knife and fork were
laid, he said, “Not a bit for me, sir.”</p>

<p>My uncle looked at him as if he were troubled with his ears
again, as he had been last winter. “Certainly, a nice bit,”
he said; “and close to the bone accordingly. We buy it fresh,
and we pickle it. At this time of year, the butchers make it
leather with saltpetre.”</p>

<p>Tony saw that his face was stern; and to escape acrimony,
he took my plate with all upon it that should have been for
my inside. To this sort of thing I am too much accustomed
to remonstrate.</p>

<p>“Not a word, till you have finished,” my uncle spoke
decisively; “I have known a man who cut his throat, by talking
too much at dinner-time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tonks looked not unlikely to commit this error; but
after yielding to my uncle’s orders he seemed better. Then he
crossed his knife and fork, which is a very defiant thing to do,
and said as if he shot a pea at us—“I am come to throw up my
appointment.”</p>

<p>My uncle did not speak at first. When people took him
suddenly, he would not be disturbed by any contagious gush
of suddenness. And he waited for Tony to go on, instead of
being pushed by him.</p>

<p>“What I mean is”—Tonks continued, seeing that he might
as well go slowly—“I have done the best I can; and there is
nothing more to be made of it. I can make out all about a
horse, because he is straightfor’ard. But about a man is a different
thing; and I shall go back to my business.”</p>

<p>“Have you been frightened?” asked my uncle, looking at
him steadily.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. What is there to frighten me, or any
one? In the eye of the law, we are all equal. The man who
killed me would swing as high as if he had killed Prince
Albert.”</p>

<p>“But that would not bring you back to life. You have
been frightened, Tony Tonks; and it is useless to deny it.”</p>

<p>“Well, my life is as much to me as the greatest man’s that
ever lived. ‘Frightened’ is not the proper word. Only I look
things in the face, and weigh the rusk against the risk; and
I find the last come heavier. And I am wanted now for the
Leger nags. I am worth ten pounds a week at least, so I wish
to say good-bye to you.”</p>

<p>“I call you a coward, and a sneak,” said my uncle, getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
his wrath up; “and it serves us altogether right for dealing
with such a fellow. I could not bear it from the first; but I
listened to other people, as I am always much too apt to do.
You won’t have your spy-money, I can tell you, for any day
since Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I’ve got it,” answered Mr. Tonks, who seemed
well accustomed to reproaches; “it was paid in advance, you
must remember. I have cashed it, and mean to stick to it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see how that can be,” said my uncle, with
great sagacity; “you must be making some mistake. You can
never have got so in front of us.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I have, old cock, I have. All expenses paid;
and here is my five-pound note, as safe as eggs.” He tapped
his pocket, in a manner quite unworthy of an experienced
tout.</p>

<p>“Very kind of you to show us. We will have it back.”
My uncle seized him by the waist, and planted him on the
table. “Leave him to me, Kit. He won’t hurt me, and I
won’t hurt him, if he is quiet.”</p>

<p>He pinned the spy’s arms with one of his, and took the note
from his waistcoat pocket, while the poor man struggled vainly.
Then he set him again on the floor, and said. “You should
learn to be more just, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Highway robbery!” shouted Tonks.</p>

<p>“High table, you mean,” said my uncle.</p>

<p>“I’ll fetch the police. I’ll give you in charge. I’ll take
out a warrant. I’ll—”</p>

<p>“You won’t do anything of the sort. Sit down, and
reason quietly. You have broken contract; and if you were
one of my workmen, I would pay you nothing. But as you are a
poor little jackanapes, and did your best for us, I believe,
until you got into this blue funk, you shall have half of this
money, Tonks, to pay your way back to your proper work.
But only on one condition—that you tell us what has scared
you so.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Tonks very sulkily; “I always do what
is fair and right. But you can’t expect a man to go with his
life in his hand, to please you. Fact of it is I got into grief
by following up that Migwell Bengoose, or whatever his name
is. I told you that I was bound to do it, before Downy went
to see him again, unless I could get any chance, you know, of
seeing what was in that packet. And I got no chance at all of
that, though I did my best in Bulwrag’s rooms, whenever I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
to see him. But his hand, in spite of all the doctor’s work got
swollen as big as a horse’s head pretty nearly; and his temper
became that frightful, that I scarcely durst go nigh him, and of
course there was nothing to watch, when he could scarcely get
about at all. Naturally I did my best to make something out
of his grumbles; but he would not have it, and at last he says,
‘Bowles, what the devil are you always after me for? It ain’t
from friendly affection,’ he says, ‘and I can’t pick up anything
now, you see. If you want to spy into family affairs, I’ve got
one hand left,’ he says, ‘and that’s enough for you.’</p>

<p>“Well, that was pretty plain, you know. And worse than
that, in comes the doctor, and says he will not answer for his
life, unless he goes into some place where he can be properly
nursed and tended. So Downy makes his mind up in two
minutes, gives up his rooms in Dover Street, and goes back to
Bulwrag Park, as they call it, for his mother to coddle and
comfort him. And there they’ve got a hospital nurse, and a
wheel-chair, and I don’t know what all; and much too grand
of course for me to go near with a binocle. ‘You’d better
come and see my mother, Bowles, when you want any further
information,’ Downy said to me, with his frightful grin, like a
yellow mangle-wuzzle, ‘ah, she does like answering questions—light
and sweetness, that’s her nature!’</p>

<p>“So I was shut off, as you may suppose; and I pretty soon
found out what made him so suspicious. He discovered somehow
that I had been living, for the first week, you know, not
afterwards, at good mother Wilcox’s place near by, and they
look upon her as an enemy, no doubt, having been nurse to the
young lady they have stolen. If you try any more watching
work up there, you must not make that the head-quarters, for
they keep a look-out there, you may depend. But I don’t see
what more you have now to watch. The lady is out of England,
you may take that for certain; most likely she is snug in some
lunatic asylum, or nunnery perhaps, or monastery”—Mr. Tonks
was not well versed in such matters—“either in the South of
France, or somewhere on the Continent; and unless you can
lay hold of Downy Bulwrag, and put him on the rack (as they
do in Spain) until he squeaks out all the truth, there’s no chance
of your being much the wiser. I mean, of course, unless she
escapes, or comes to herself, or whatever it may be, and tells
you all about it with her own lips; and that is not very likely.
They know what they are about, a great deal better than you
do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because they are scoundrels, and we are honest men,”
said my uncle, making the little room resound; “it may take
a long time, but we shall win, and grind them beneath our heels,
sir. You have seen as much robbery, Tony Tonks, as any
man yet created. Now don’t deny it, don’t falter with it;
but speak, as you will have to speak that day, when you go
where lies are useless. Have you ever known cheating
prosper?”</p>

<p>“Better than anything else in the world. You can’t get on
without it, Mr. Orchardson.”</p>

<p>“You know what I mean. Don’t play with words. Does
it prosper in the long run?”</p>

<p>“It would, if they only knew when to stop; but that is
just where the difference is. An honest man stops in good time,
you know.”</p>

<p>“An honest man never begins,” said my uncle; “but it is
no good talking to you, Tonks. You have got corrupted
altogether. Well, what did you do about Bengoose?”</p>

<p>“Ah that’s just the point, that is. Says I to myself—‘Now
the coast is clear, and I’ll have a turn at that fellow. Downy
is laid up with his mammy, and I’ll get to the bottom of that
affair.’ So I set off last night, with a pistol in my pocket, one
of those Colt’s revolver things; for I knew it was a bad place,
and they might not stick at trifles. And sure enough, they
didn’t, as you must acknowledge. I came up very quiet, and
knocked gently at the door and said ‘Cluck!’ as the fellow
gave the ticket. It was opened very civil, and I asked for
Migwell Bengoose, and the man said ‘All right, just wait a
minute.’ A little dark place it was under the stairs, and I did
not much like the look of it; for I could hear a lot of voices
further on, and they seemed to be drinking and card-playing.
However, I sat down where I was told, and began to think over
my story. My plan was to tell him that the Captain was ill,
and had sent me to say that the papers were all right, but he
would like to know how he got hold of them, and where he
could get the others that were mentioned in them, and to pay
him a sovereign, just to keep things going, till the Captain
should be about again. The fellow would remember seeing me
with him, and I had made up a very nice tale of it.</p>

<p>“But the smell of the place was something awful, worse
than all the bookmakers put together, and there is plenty to
spare when you get among them. Either that, or something
else, made me feel quite heavy, and I began to doze a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
though I fought very hard against it. And all of a sudden,
before I could jump up, there was a leather strap round me, and
my arms were buckled in it, as tight as you had me on the
table, Squire; and a deal worse than that, for I was fastened to
the chair, with a dollop of some stinking stuff across my eyes
and mouth, so that I was blind and pretty well choked. Then
my legs were tied together as tight as any hayband, and in that
way I was left, I shall never know how long, to listen to a lot
of blackguards laughing. There were women cackling too
among the hooting of the men, and they cried ‘Cluck, cluck, my
noble cock!’ and the worse I tried to rave at them the better
they enjoyed it. Then they searched me, and took all my
money, and my pistol, and threw me, chair and all, upon the
floor, and whacked me on the arms and legs with a towel
knotted up.</p>

<p>“I thought my last moment was come; and it would have
been, if I had not shammed dead, and rolled over against the
wall, where I got a little air, by rubbing the sacking against it,
for I could not get my hands near my mouth. Then they began
to talk in some thieves’ lingo, which I could not make head or
tail of. But the upshot was that they released my face, and
gave me some horrible stuff to drink, and let me lie there the
Lord knows how long. I would rather die straight off than
have such another night, for I saw great holes in the floor, and
expected to be pitched down, and never come up again.</p>

<p>“At last a big fellow came and untied me, and pitched me
out of the cellar-flap. ‘Had enough of cluck, cluck, haven’t
you, old chap?’ he said as he banged the door behind me. And
I found it was daylight, and I was in the court where I hid
behind the truck from Downy. I was in such a state that I
could scarcely crawl; but a good-natured coster put me on his
barrow, and took me to Drury Lane, and there I found a cab.
I never saw Bengoose all the time; but no doubt he had
arranged it all, under orders from Downy Bulwrag. If you don’t
think I have had enough of this job, I do, Mr. Orchardson.”</p>

<p>“Show your legs,” said my uncle, with a smile in which
there was not too much compassion; “I don’t wish to be hard
upon a man in trouble; but you are given to romance a little,
by your own account, friend Tonks.”</p>

<p>“Never to my employers, sir. But look here!”</p>

<p>His poor little drumsticks had plainly been acting the part
of the drum quite recently, and were painted of divers colours,
while a broad stripe showed where the ligaments had been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have a better opinion of you, Tonks, than I ever expected
to have,” said my uncle. “You are a plucky little chap.
Here’s your five-pound note, for you have earned it. It was
your fault that I took it from you, because you defied me.
Now go back to your proper work. And if ever you come this
way, look in, and I will give you a good dinner.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIV.<br />

<small>PRINCE’S MANSION.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> any man has once got into a racing state of mind, it is
not fair to his bodily health to keep him in a wheatfield. Sam
Henderson had been expected, by his bride and her female
relatives, to walk about in country places, and sit on stiles, and
admire the moon; like a young man from Whitechapel coming
to feel his way to be a teacher. Sam had borne it pretty well,
as a thing not likely to come twice, till he found it too much
to come once. For he was not of my quiet nature; and
still less could it be supposed that his Sally was like my
Kitty.</p>

<p>He went off to some races at York, I think, or somewhere
nicely convenient, for they were on the eastern coast; and he
offered, as fairly as a man could do, to let his bride come with
him. But she said she saw too much of horses at home, and
preferred to remain with her landlady. He thought that she
was too independent, and she thought the same of him; but
they soon made up that little matter, and came home to
Halliford as affectionate as need be.</p>

<p>Sam was beginning to boast about his condition prematurely.
If any friend of his replied to his sudden invitations—“Sam,
I should be most delighted; but it might be
inconvenient, you know, to Mrs. Henderson”—Sam would
look at him with a laugh, and say—“The best soul living, my
dear boy. Always proud to welcome any friend of mine, at
any time. We pull together, and no mistake. You may come
with your coat on inside out, and she won’t say a word, till I
do.”</p>

<p>To this I listened very gravely, knowing what a good wife
is, but doubting whether it can be wise to take such liberties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
with her. And I knew that Sam was a pleasant fellow, partly
because of his bounce and brag. Whatever belonged to him
became pure gold or glittering jewel; as there are Oriental
gems, which glow at the touch of the owner. Nobody had such
dogs or horses, nobody had such clever men; and now we were
to believe that no one had ever owned such a wonder of a
wife.</p>

<p>“Let us go and see how they get on,” I said to my Uncle
Corny, when a grand invitation on gilt paper was brought by
a man in a pink silk jacket, riding a horse full of ringlets;
“‘Mr. and Mrs. Henderson beg to be favoured with the
company of Mr. Orchardson, and his nephew Mr. Christopher
Orchardson, at dinner at half-past six o’clock on Tuesday, the
12th instant.’ And look at the top in gold letters, uncle—‘Prince’s
Mansion, Halliford!’”</p>

<p>“Prince’s Mansion!” cried my uncle; “get my specs, or I
won’t believe it. Well, there are fools in this world! I knew
they had got into that old ramshackle house, that was let to
some foreign fellow, who bolted from his creditors. Prince’s
Mansion! Oh my goodness! Why don’t they say—Windsor
Castle? You may go, if you like. But you don’t catch me.
And half-past six! I couldn’t wait till then. It’s too late for
dinner, and too early for supper. You go and see them, and
say I won’t come.”</p>

<p>“But it must be answered on paper, uncle. And you must
never say you won’t come, you must say you can’t.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to tell any lie about it. I can go
well enough, if I choose; but I don’t. You suppose that I
don’t know how to behave. I can behave as well as the best
of them.”</p>

<p>“You have got a blue coat with brass buttons,” I said on
purpose to irritate him; “it was all the fashion twenty years
ago; but I am afraid you have got too fat for it.”</p>

<p>“You are getting horribly cheeky, Kit. You are catching
it from that Henderson. What would Kitty say, if she were
here? There, I never meant to vex you, lad. I’ll go, if that
will please you.”</p>

<p>When the great day came, my uncle looked as well as the
very best of them. He had an old Sunday coat let out, for he
would not buy a new one, and he wore his big watch with
three gold seals, and black silk stockings, and knee-breeches.
Also he had a velvet waistcoat, double-breasted with coral
buttons, which he had bought for my wedding-day, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
frilled shirt, and his white curls brushed in a very becoming
frizzle. “A’ look’th like a bishop,” old Tabby pronounced,
though perhaps she had never seen one; “but no bishop han’t
got such legs as thiccy.”</p>

<p>Aunt Parslow, as an old friend of Sally Chalker, was
invited specially, and came over in style with a pair of horses,
and her dinner-dress done up in a long silken package. She
called at my uncle’s on her way to Prince’s Mansion, and they
laughed so that I was surprised at their manners, considering
who was to feed them that day. But perhaps they felt no
gratitude before they got it.</p>

<p>It was a good step to Sam’s house, for Prince’s Mansion
stood in the upper part of his grounds, nearly half a mile from
his “Doctor’s Shop,” as he called the place where he had
feasted me, and where he had been content to live. Though
the days were now getting short again, and our road led away
from the village, it was likely enough that we might come
across neighbours, who would be astonished at my uncle’s appearance,
and could hardly fail to run home, and publish throughout
the village that the grower was out of his right mind at
last.</p>

<p>To save any difficulty about this, we sent for Sims and his
ancient fly, and putting up the windows, went in state to the
dinner at Prince’s Mansion.</p>

<p>My uncle had been positive and almost snappish, in asserting
his knowledge of the world; and I had given him credit on
the strength of that for knowing almost everything. But now
he showed signs of some anxiety and doubt, as we passed through
the gate at the beginning of the drive, and he glanced at his
nails, which were of a steady brown, and his knuckles, which
resembled door-knobs.</p>

<p>“There won’t be any ladies, of course,” he said, “besides
Mrs. Sam and Aunt Parslow. Just look to my collar, this side,
Kit. It seems to cut uncommon hard.”</p>

<p>“Ladies?” I replied; “why, there’ll be a dozen, according
to what Sam said yesterday. There are three Miss Chalkers,
Sally’s aunts, and three Miss Kempes, her cousins, and Mrs.
Spry from Tonbridge Wells, and three or four racing ladies, and
a very fashionable one, and very beautiful I believe, whose name
is Lady Kickloose. So you see your velvet waistcoat won’t be
wasted, Uncle Corny.”</p>

<p>“If I had known this, I would have stopped at home. Why
I shall have one on each arm! I like people to talk with that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
know all about. By-the-bye, I forget—which arm is considered
the most polite to walk with?”</p>

<p>“It does not matter much. But you will do very well, if
you don’t begin to tell any of your long stories. People won’t
have them now. All they care for is what they call general
conversation.”</p>

<p>“If I am not allowed to tell my old stories,” my uncle
replied indignantly, “all I can do is to hold my tongue. What
is the good of bits and splinters? You can’t make anybody
laugh like that. You must take your time, and let them think
what’s coming. It’s just the same as carrying a pint of beer.
If you are jogged on the elbow all the froth runs over. I give
a man his time, and I like to have my own.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, and they’ll be glad enough to listen to you,
when they have had their own talk out. But one thing I want
you to do particularly. You are so sharp in seeing everything.
You observe so much better than I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t expect to be equal to me yet. Though
you are not a fool, Kit; not half so much a fool as some who
think they are mighty clever. What is it you want me to notice,
my boy?”</p>

<p>“Why, I want you to notice particularly how Sally behaves
to her husband. To hear him talk, one would suppose that he
had got a perfect jewel—a model of a wife that worships him,
and would crawl on her knees to please him. In fact, you would
think she was fifty times the wonder that my Kitty was. But
from what I know of Sally Chalker, I don’t believe a word of
it.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Jealous, is it?” he answered most absurdly.
“I’ll keep my eyes wide open, Kit, and report accordingly.”</p>

<p>Sam Henderson was a most hospitable fellow, and not a
single word shall pass my lips which might be twisted by
captious persons into a reflection upon him. He sat at the
bottom of his table, and he never took his eyes from the plates
on the right hand and the left, except when he was calling
Tom, his groom to change them, or to fetch them that he might
put more on each. Even Lady Kickloose, who was a very
lovely woman, could not make demand keep pace with the
quick abundance of supply. Hence it was the more unreasonable,
and I might even say despotic, on the part of the new
Mrs. Henderson, that she kept on calling down the table—“Sam,
look at father’s plate, he never will mind himself, you
know;” or—“Sam, can’t you see that Aunt Maggy has not got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
a morsel?” or—“Mr. Henderson, Lady Kickloose has never
had one drop of gravy!”</p>

<p>“All right, my love. Beg pardon, I am sure. Tom, why
don’t you move a little quicker?”—poor Sam Henderson would
reply. But I thought it was not “all right, my love,” that a
man who was doing his best for us all, and getting but a
snap or two for his own mouth, should be hurried and flurried
in this sort of way, and almost accused of inattention to his guests.
I could scarcely help saying—“Do let him alone;” but I knew
the proprieties too well for that.</p>

<p>“You are right, ma’am; she does look beautiful,” I heard
my uncle say to one of the three unmarried aunts; and then he
gazed at her with as much admiration, as if she had been—no
matter who, but some one very different.</p>

<p>And I was pleased to see a large piece of greens drop from
his mouth into his grand breast-frill, which put him out of
countenance for half an hour. In my poor opinion, his
admiration was as much out of place as that piece of greens,
though I will not deny that our hostess was what is called a
very fine young woman. She wore a dress of green satin, which
I never could endure any more than Kitty could; and the
way it was cut below the neck and shoulders filled me with
surprise that Sam allowed it; but perhaps he could not help
himself. I was glad to see Miss Parslow looking shocked, and
I glanced at her and then at it, but she did not think fit to
comprehend. Uncle Corny on the other hand surprised me by
treating it as a joke rather than a scandal; gentlemen wore
cut-away coats, he said, and why should not ladies wear cut-away
gowns?</p>

<p>Presently I happened to catch some words from the lower
end of the table, which drew my attention from Sam’s wife, and
brought it back to my own affairs. The dinner was a very good
and solid one; not fifty varieties of unknown substance, such
as we too often meet with; and yet quite enough of change for
the most inconstant person. There was very nice white soup,
and mock turtle—not the real, such as my Aunt Parslow gave,
but quite as good, if not better—then a cod of great size and
high character, with oysters as fat as mushrooms; and after
that a saddle of mutton at one end, and an aitch-bone, not over-boiled,
at the other; one lying down, and the other standing
up. Foreigners may disguise their stuff, which by their own
confession requires it. But an Englishman likes to know what
he is at, that his conscience may go with his stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>These things are trifles, in a way of speaking; but if they
lead up to a pleasant state of mind, it is not friendly to neglect
them; and my Uncle Corny, who had kept himself to bread and
cheese at his proper dinner-time, was rejoicing, as a just man
does, in the victory of his merits. Such joy is generally premature;
if he had only known what was to come, he would
have thrown down knife and fork, and waited.</p>

<p>For as if by magic, there appeared, in front of Sam himself,
and almost making him look trivial, the most magnificent bird
that ever alighted on any table. I asked a young lady what it
was; and she said—“The swan of the Romans.” It did not
become me to contradict her; but I thought that the Romans
must have owned a breed of swans superior to ours, for this
one had a peacock’s tail spread out. Everybody looked at
everybody else, while Sam turned his cuffs up, and sharpened a
new knife.</p>

<p>“Round with the champagne, Tom! We will drink my
wife’s health.” As he spoke, he had his eyes upon the peacock’s
tail; and rude as it was, all the company laughed.</p>

<p>A pair of large tongues had been put before me, and as I
began to carve them, I heard a lady say—“No fear. Downy
will be flush of money now. Be down on him sharp; that’s
the way to do it.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it will come off?” asked the gentleman she
was talking to; and I saw that it was Mr. Welch, a great man
of the ring, speaking earnestly to Lady Kickloose.</p>

<p>“What is to prevent it? The fatal day is named. It is
too good for him, as everybody says. But you know where
marriages are made.”</p>

<p>“And where they end, with a fellow of that sort. But I
can’t take it down—even now I can’t. Such a lot of brass, you
know, my lady! And what has he got to show for it?”</p>

<p>“Brass—and his mother;” replied the lady, who had
picked up the pithy style of the turf. “The old Earl is a
duffer. Mother Bull can walk round him any Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but young ladies have wills of their own. It is out
of my line, but I have always heard that Lady Clara could have
the pick of England. What can there be in Downy, to fetch
her so?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell you, Mr. Welch! Such things happen
continually. All we have to do is to follow them up. I never
liked the man; but that is no reason why she shouldn’t.
Bread-sauce, I suppose goes with peacock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam was in his glory all this time, and the dinner went on
very merrily, with plenty of laughing, and glasses clinking, and
even the most demure ladies smiling. My uncle, who had
cherished a pure contempt for sporting men, began to think
better of them, and more and more as his opinion was
asked, delivered it on subjects he had never heard of. Aunt
Parslow also was exceedingly good-natured, and held a very
interesting talk with a lady who had heard of her father. And
I took the opportunity, before we went away, to remind Mrs.
Henderson of our old doings, when she was the belle of
Leatherhead; and I thought that she looked at me very
nicely, and felt very deeply for my present sad condition; and
after all I could not contradict my uncle, when he said—with
five and sixpence in his pocket, which he had won by very fine
play at whist—that we had been treated most handsomely and
kindly, and if he should be asked to their Christmas dinner, he
meant to make a point of going.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LV.<br />

<small>RELIEF OF MIND.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">But</span> what I had heard about Downy Bulwrag rooted itself more
and more in my mind. Since the departure of Tony Tonks
(who would never have been invited to that grand dinner, for
even racing people must draw the line somewhere), I had made up
my mind to go and see the arch-enemy, as soon as ever he
should be in his proper health again. And with an eye to
that, I had written to Mrs. Wilcox, requesting her to let me
know of his first re-appearance.</p>

<p>It was not my desire to fall upon this villain, at a time
when he could not defend himself, for I did not intend to mince
matters with him, if once I could come to close quarters. And
even of those who insist most strongly on the Christian
duty of forgiveness, and look down from the greatest height
upon the littleness of resentment, probably few—if they cared
to speak the truth—would have put up with things as I did.</p>

<p>It was all very fine for the people to say—“Take it easily,
my dear friend. With patience, and the will of God, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
will find everything come right; and by-and-by, you will be
surprised at your own excitement about it.”</p>

<p>The thing that surprised me most of all was my own power
of endurance; and sometimes I felt quite hot inside, at having
two strong arms, and doing nothing with them. “It was not
thus you won your Kitty, but by knocking down Sam Henderson,”
the springy part of my conscience said sometimes to the
spongy half of it; “if you let rogues have their way, you are
only a rogue yourself, and a coward.”</p>

<p>This reproach I did not deserve. No fear of bodily harm
to myself had crossed my thoughts for a moment; but the dread
of some reckless act had been perpetually with me. It was
easy enough to do violent things; to cut myself off for ever
from all hope of love and happiness, without much chance of
even learning the secret of my misery. The enemy I feared, in
the burst of pent-up fury, was myself.</p>

<p>I began to forget this discretion now. That the man, who
had ruined my life to gorge some filthy spite of his own, should
now jump up in the world, and crow, and dance, with gold in
his pockets, and love in his arms, while I lay a widower on two
chairs; that he should have grins on his vile yellow face, while
my Kitty was weeping her eyes out somewhere; and that
every one should take it as a thing of course, and praise his
sagacity and worship him—if justice had broken her beam like
this, what law could there be to bind any one? The scoundrel
had come to gloat upon my sorrow; I would just return the
call, and have a word with him.</p>

<p>Fearing the loss of my self-command, I took not even a
walking-stick, nor the true Briton’s mainstay, an umbrella,
although the day was showery. Neither did I change my
working-clothes, but without a word to any one, saddled old
<i>Spanker</i>, and started directly after breakfast. In an hour, I
dismounted at the door of Mrs. Wilcox, and gave the sharp boy
my horse to lead about.</p>

<p>“Whatever can be the matter with you, Master Kit?”
his mother inquired very kindly. “You don’t look a bit like
yourself, sir. Do come in; I have got a sight to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; when I come back will do. I am going to
pay a little call—not more than half an hour.” Before she
could answer, I was out of hearing.</p>

<p>“When I rang and knocked loudly at the door of the old
house, a man servant came, and I was glad of that; for I could
not have forced my way past a woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish to see Mr. Bulwrag,” I said.</p>

<p>“Never sees any one at this time of day. He has not
finished breakfast yet,” answered the man.</p>

<p>“It does not matter. I must see him. I have heard that
he is quite well again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he is well enough;” the man gave a smile, which
meant—a great deal better than he deserves to be—“but you
must call again in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I intend to see him now. Show me the
room, if you please, my friend.”</p>

<p>“That is the room. But you must not go in.” He offered
no resistance, when he saw that it would not stop me; and I
knocked at the door, and then entered.</p>

<p>Donovan Bulwrag wore a dressing-gown, braided with gold,
and was lighting a cigar, after making (as the dishes showed) a
long and goodly breakfast.</p>

<p>“Holloa! Who are you?” His tone was rough and
arrogant; but I saw by his eyes that he knew me, and his
heavy mouth was twitching. “What the devil do you mean,
by coming in like this?”</p>

<p>“Are you in your usual health and strength?” I would not
have touched him, if he had answered, “No.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, I am. But what business is that of yours? I
always kick insolent cads out of the room.”</p>

<p>“I will not foul my tongue with any words to you. My
business is to lead you three times round this room, by the nose.
Now try to stop me.” As I spoke, I was putting on a gardening
glove.</p>

<p>He struck at me with all his force; but I dashed up his fist
with my left hand, while with the right I got a firm grip upon
his bulky nose. In vain he let fly at me, right and left; I did
not even feel his blows, though the marks were plain long
afterwards. Then he tried to grapple me; but I would not
have it. Three times round the room I led him, while he
roared and shrieked with pain, and then I flung him backward
into his easy chair.</p>

<p>I cannot say how I was enabled to do this; and I doubt
whether any one can explain it. But before I felt the difficulty,
it was over; and I was fit to do it again, if needful.</p>

<p>Downy Bulwrag had never been amazed before, because he
was a cold-blooded fellow; and that made it all the worse for
him, when he could not avoid it. I am thankful to the
Lord—who has always guided me, when I do not depart too far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
from Him—that this happened so; for my heart was up, and
my brain had not a whisper left in it. Life and death are mere
gossamer, at such moments.</p>

<p>On the table lay a long sharp ham-knife. If Bulwrag had
said a word, or even stirred, he would never have done one or
other again. That knife would have been in his heart. And
I—well, the gallows and the devil would be welcome to me
afterwards. He saw my eyes dwell on that blade, and he was
cowed. He knew that he had a madman standing over him;
and happily for both of us, he fell into a faint.</p>

<p>“Blackguard,” I shouted, “you have had a narrow shave.
This comes of meddling between man and wife.”</p>

<p>I seized the long knife, while he pawed with his fat hands,
and flung it just clear of his big yellow head. The blade cleft
the panel of black oak behind him, and quivered, and rang like
the tongue of a bell.</p>

<p>Without another word I left him thus, flinging the door of
the room wide open, that every one might see his condition.
The footman, or whatever he called himself, fell back against
the wall, and let me pass, which was the only wise thing he
could do. Then I walked away quietly, and found my horse,
and declining all talk with Mrs. Wilcox rode back to Sunbury
with a great weight off my mind.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER LVI.<br />

<small>ANOTHER TRACE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">So</span> far as my experience goes, it has never been an easy thing
to find a man in whom the sense of justice is adjusted perfectly.
That is to say, not overdrawn, nor strained to a pitch
that is at discord with all human nature; neither on the other
hand so lax and flabby, that it yields to every breath, and has
no distinctive tone. Therefore I cannot expect to be approved
by everybody for my recent act; but the glow of a tender
conscience told me that I had not behaved amiss.</p>

<p>Yet the remembrance of my own rage, and utter loss of
self-command, frightened me more than I can express, for a
single word, a look, a gesture, even a flicker across my own
will would have made me then and there a murderer. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
a thing for Kitty to hear—if ever she should hear of me again—that
my unhappy love of her had been cut short by the
hangman! I formed the sensible resolve to keep out of Bulwrag’s
way henceforth, unless he should come to seek me; and
then his blood must be on his own head.</p>

<p>At first I did not tell my uncle of that brief but hot engagement,
because, as I came to think about it, the folly of it
dawned on me. For the fierce enjoyment of a minute, I had
sacrificed all hope of tracing such faint clues as we had won,
and I had shown the arch-enemy in the most palpable form,
my suspicions of him. This was unsound policy, and I was
loth to confess it yet, lest my chief friend should be discouraged,
as well as angry with me. However, the whole thing soon
came out, and with so much more tacked on to it, that I was
forced to recount the simple facts. But instead of being vexed,
as in my opinion a truly wise man must have been, my uncle
shouted with delight, and shook his thick sides with laughter.</p>

<p>“So you pulled his nose! Kit Orchardson pulled the nose
of the future Lord Roarmore, and the son-in-law of the Earl
of Clerinhouse! Show me how you did it. This is too fine!”</p>

<p>“No. I scarcely pulled his nose. I cannot be said to have
pulled his nose. All I did was to take him by the nose, and he
came after it wonderfully.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see. He just followed his nose; and a lawyer
could prove that there was no assault. A man follows his
nose without assault or battery. Well, I never thought you
were so clever, Kit.”</p>

<p>“Because I never boast,” I answered calmly; and it
struck him for the first time that this might be so.</p>

<p>“What will he do?” he asked; “whatever will he do?
He can’t very well put up with it; and yet how can he get
satisfaction? You wouldn’t fight him, I suppose, even if he
deigned to ask you.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of it. Let him try. He has done the
wickedness. What I have done is nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think it was something good—the very best
thing you could have done; much better than knocking him
down, or even cow-hiding him, as the Yankees say. How
your Aunt Parslow will be delighted! She is coming over
here to-morrow. You know what you put into her head.
She will call on the parson again about it. The poor girl is
very ill; worse than ever. I hope he will agree to it.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Parslow seems very fond of Sunbury now,” I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
replied, with a curious glance at him; “why should she
always be coming over here so?”</p>

<p>“You had better ask her. I daresay she can answer for
herself. You must not expect to pull everybody’s nose.”</p>

<p>It had lately appeared to me, more and more, as if my
Aunt Parslow were beginning to set her cap at my Uncle Corny;
or rather—to put it more politely—as if he were doffing his
wide-awake to her—a wide-awake proceeding, no doubt, on his
part, and a proof of capacity on hers; but not a thing at all to
my liking, nor in any way savouring of those lofty feelings
which are so essential to wedlock. And without any mercenary
motives whatever, or even a dream of self-seeking, I had felt
(with good grounds for it) a delicate and genial interest in my
dear aunt’s affairs. If after countless years of single blessedness,
she thought to double the rest by a joint-stock company,
all I could do was to wish her well, and hope profoundly for
her happiness. There were few better men than my Uncle
Corny, and no woman better than my Aunt Parslow; and
they might rub on together rarely, if each would let the other
rub, fair turn and turn about. But I feared that they scarcely
had the give-and-take for that, and being both of strong metal,
it would come to groans and sparks.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I must put up with events; and the little
inquiry I had offered, as above, had not been received with
gratitude. The surest way to bring this wild idea into fact,
would be for me to show opposition to it. But I knew that
Aunt Parslow was still romantic, as all women of true nature
are. She had felt her own love affairs in early days; but she
would not want to think that Uncle Corny had felt his; and
I resolved to let her hear of them by his own sighs; if he could
be brought to sigh about anything but markets.</p>

<p>When she arrived the next day, I saw that she was in fine
spirits. But a little ashamed, as it seemed to me, of the exceedingly
spirited dress she wore, quite as if she were going to
the races. Moreover, she had brought <i>Jupiter</i>, as if to introduce
him to some one who might influence his future life; and
at this I ventured to express surprise, in a friendly manner, and
with my hand upon his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, he does love a change, and it does him so much good!”
she exclaimed, as if she had been in her teens; “and I should
like to hear what Mr. Orchardson thinks of him. He is a good
judge of dogs, you said.”</p>

<p>Alas, if one ever tells a story, how quick it is in kicking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
its heels! In charity, I had said something of the kind, when
I wished to make goodwill between them. Here was <i>Jupiter</i>
come to prove me a liar, and perhaps to sway my destinies.</p>

<p>“Don’t get out with that lovely dress on,” I said very craftily.
“Let us go down to Mr. Golightly’s; I know that you
want to see him. I will jump on the box, and show coachy the
way. It will save you a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>Accordingly we drove on to the parson’s, and I went in to
announce her. She had called upon him twice before, and he
liked her, and was grateful for her good intentions.</p>

<p>He received us kindly; but we could see that his heart was
in nothing he was talking of. He looked most sadly worn
and thin, and his eyes fell every now and then, as a short low
cough came from another room.</p>

<p>“And how is your sweet Bessy?” Miss Parslow asked;
“you know she is quite an old friend of mine. What a favour
you could do me, if you only would! I have taken such
a liking to her.”</p>

<p>“And she to you. I will go and fetch her. I fear you will
find her looking very little stronger.”</p>

<p>“Call this furniture! I call it hardware,” my aunt said in
a low tone, when he had left the room; “no wonder the poor
girl is all bones. Now back me up, Kit, about Baycliff. It is
your prescription, you remember.”</p>

<p>It was as much as my aunt could do, being of a very kindly
nature, to keep a smile upon her face, when the sickly girl
came towards her. And the father looked from one to the
other, and tried to make some little joke, but his eyes were
sparkling with something else.</p>

<p>“You know what you promised me, my dear, if your good
father would allow it;” Miss Parslow stroked her silky hair,
and looked into her soft eyes, as she spoke; “and now everything
is arranged and settled, I am sure you will not throw
me over. The rooms are taken, and I cannot go alone; it would
be so miserable for me. Your father will come to see you
every week, and you shall teach him to catch prawns. And
where do you suppose it is? Not at any strange place at all, but
a place my nephew knows quite well, and the very same house
that he was in. And he would come down, and be near us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be nice. I should not feel strange. Kit
is so kind and gentle to me. I like to be where Kit is.”</p>

<p>She came and placed her thin hands in mine; for I had
become like an elder brother to her. She knew of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
sorrow, and I of hers. It was not this world that she grieved to
quit, but her father all alone in it.</p>

<p>It was a terrible pain to me, and almost more than I could
bear, to find myself in this lovely place, without any love to
respond to it. At every turn there was something to recall, at
every view of gliding boat, or breaking wave, or flitting gull,
some memory of a trifle said, and misery of having no one now
to say it. But for the good of others I was forced to put these
fancies by, for we could not have found another spot so suitable
for the poor sick child. And as it proved, there was something
even here to compensate me.</p>

<p>It had not been thought worth while to take any lodgings for
me in the place, as I could not be spared throughout the week
from the busy fruit season at Sunbury. Whenever I found
time to run down to Baycliff, I could get a bed at the inn, and
spend the day with my aunt and her delicate charge. This
suited me also much better, because I did not like to be long
away from the neighbourhood of London, where, as I always
felt somehow, the strange mystery of my life must be cleared
up, if it ever were so.</p>

<p>Mrs. Perowne was a very nice person, and deeply interested
in our affairs. Kitty and I had lodged with her for a week,
and although we could not afford to take her best rooms, she
treated us exactly like first-floor people, and would have kept
us for nothing, as she assured us, if only she could have
afforded it. And now it rejoiced me to do her a good turn, by
inducting my aunt at three guineas a week, which was nothing
for her to think twice of. Six of the Leatherhead dogs came
down for the refreshment of their systems, and Miss Golightly
was delighted with them, and spent half the day on the sands
scratching their heads. The weather was all that could be
wished, for we were come to the end of September now; and
the summer as a whole had done its utmost to atone for the
atrocities of the year before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Perowne and Miss Parslow now were as good friends
as any two people can be, with money coming weekly between
them. And they never spent less than an hour a day in talking
of my loss and wondering. Till it chanced that the landlady
called to mind a little thing that happened after we had left
her, and to which she had paid no attention at the time. But
my aunt considered it of some importance, and begged her to
tell me all about it, the very next Saturday I should come down.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Kit,” she said, upon the Sunday morning, for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
I had been too late on Saturday to see them; “it may have
been a week after you were gone, or it may have been no more
than one day, but at any rate there came to this house a very
quiet gentleman, not over young, about fifty you might say,
and not over tall, but about half-way between five feet and
six feet, and he asked for you—Mr. Orchardson by name, and
then the new Mrs. Orchardson. And when our Jenny told
him that you were gone, he sighed, Jenny says—though you
never must be certain of anything that Jenny says—just as if
he had lost his pocket-book. And then he asked for me, and
he was shown up here, the drawing-room floor being vacant, as
you may remember; and I came up to see him, but I happened
to be a little flustered, about having all the house on my hands
so. And when I found that he was not even looking out for
lodgings, perhaps I was a little short with him. But whether
or no, he did not push on with his questions as some people do.
But he took up his hat, and begged me to excuse him for
intruding upon my valuable time, and away he went with a
very solid walk, and I was sorry afterwards.”</p>

<p>“But what was he like? Can you at all describe him?
Even his dress would help a little.” I thought it most likely
that this was the man who had come for my Kitty in Philip
Moggs’ boat, and taken her doubtless in Clipson’s cab from
Shepperton to Woking Road.</p>

<p>“I think I should know him, if I saw him again; but
I won’t be quite sure,” replied Mrs. Perowne; “he was a
gentleman I should say decidedly, though not in a fashionable
cut of clothes; and I think he had gray hair, though I won’t
be sure, because so many people have that now. He looked
highly educated, and his voice was very nice, and he wore a
broad hat with a cord to it.”</p>

<p>“Why, it must be the Professor himself,” exclaimed my
aunt; “according to all I have heard of him, and according
to your description, Kit. He came to see how you were getting
on, and whether you and Kitty had fought yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that reminds me of a curious thing; and I thought
it so odd,” said the landlady; “he did seem to think that you
must have quarrelled, or at least that there was something
unpleasant between you, I remember now that he did quite
well, because I was astonished at such an idea. For if ever
there was a young couple suited—intended by the Lord for one
another—”</p>

<p>“It cannot have been the Professor,” I broke in, “for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
simple reason that he must already have left the shores of
England. We had a telegram from Falmouth proving that.
And her father would never for a moment have imagined that
Kitty and I had fallen out already. What did this man say,
to show that he supposed it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that he did exactly that; but he
inquired particularly about your health, or rather I should say
your state of mind, as if you were not quite—you know what I
mean—as if you were rather flighty, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, and so I am,” I answered smiling; “a great many
people would have flown off altogether, if they had been through
half what I have. And now this again is another wicked
puzzle for me. The only thing certain is that I shall never find
it out. I always come just a bit too late. I hear of a thing
when it is no good. I inquire of people, when they have
forgotten everything.”</p>

<p>This was rather rude of me; for Mrs. Perowne had done
her best to assist me; and she could not be blamed for not
talking by the hour with a stranger, about her late lodger’s
affairs.</p>

<p>“Did he say what he meant to do?” I asked, for really all
these things were very tantalizing; “did he give you any idea
why he should take such an interest in us? Did he ask
where we were? Did he mention my uncle? Did he go on,
as if—”</p>

<p>“I am truly sorry, Mr. Kit, I am indeed. But I can’t tell
you another thing about him. And I am not sure that all I
have told you occurred. Some of it may have come out of
my own head, I can’t carry everything, I can’t indeed.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Perowne was almost crying, and it was plainly useless
to question her further. Such is evidence, even with
people who are not fools, and who do their very best. Yet in
a court of justice, an unhappy witness is badgered and insulted
by some brazen-headed fellow, who could not tell a tale
himself in its true order, if he had just read it in a spelling-book.</p>

<p>The only conclusion I could come to was that Mrs.
Perowne’s visitor and the passenger in the boat and cab, who
had taken my wife away, were one and the same person,
acting no doubt under Bulwrag’s orders. But why he should
have shown himself in the first case plainly, and made his
second visit in that furtive manner, was more than I could
even pretend to explain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>Another thing which I could not explain was of a different
and delightful order. Rejoicing in the sea-air and in the sea
itself, Bessy Golightly grew stronger every day. The wan
delicacy and waxen clearness began to flush with a rosy gleam,
her eyes looked darker and yet full of light; and her lips instead
of drooping at the corners crisped their pretty curves
with a lively smile. Miss Parslow was as proud as a hen
that has struck an ant’s nest, and took her to the china shop
every day to be admired, and to the station to be weighed.
And whenever her father came to see her, with “six hours
allowed at the sea-side,” he spent all the six in looking at
her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER LVII.<br />

<small>A VAIN APPEAL.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">Possibly</span> I might do something with him,” said Mr. Golightly
to me one day; “I have not much power of persuasion;
but if I put a few simple truths before him, and showed him
the wickedness of his present course, and how wanton is the
injury he has done you, without even the shadow of good to
himself, he might try even now to make amends. I can easily
get an introduction to him. I suppose you would forgive him,
if your dear wife were restored. It would be a noble thing to
do.”</p>

<p>“Too noble for me, I greatly fear. But he will never forgive
me. If he hated me, when I had never harmed him,
what is he likely to do now?”</p>

<p>As yet I had concealed from this conscientious pastor my
recent act of rudeness, for I could not expect him to look upon
it as the discharge of a Christian duty. But now it seemed
better that he should have the story from me, than from some
one who might give an unkind turn to it. And he sensibly
perceived that as the thing was done, it was useless now to
remonstrate.</p>

<p>“It was not a magnanimous act at all,” he replied with a
grave shake of his head; “but allowance must be made for
provocation; even Mr. Bulwrag must feel that, if he has at
all a candid mind. I should not let that discourage me in the
least, if you think fit to accept my services; and after all your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
kind acts to me and my dear child, it would be a very happy
day for me—one of the happiest of my life, if I could really
help you. Let me try, I entreat you; it can do no harm, and
it may do good.”</p>

<p>“You would only expose yourself to rudeness. He is
rough and contemptuous in his manner, and has no respect for
any one.”</p>

<p>“His rudeness would not injure me. But I do not think
that he would show any. I am well acquainted with a cousin
of the lady whom he seeks to marry. He was my churchwarden
at Knightsbridge, and I became much attached to him. Mr.
Bulwrag, for his own sake, will not be rude to any one so
introduced.”</p>

<p>This of course made a great difference; and as Mr. Golightly
pressed the matter, I consented gratefully, though without
seeing even the smallest chance of any good to come from it.
However, it would enable me to hear something of that
scoundrel, after whom I now began to feel a sort of stupid
hankering; such as the young robin has for the cat; or the
mallard on the mere about the strange proceedings of that dog
among the reeds.</p>

<p>A more unpromising embassy might no man ever undertake;
and having still some pride alive, in spite of deadly blows to it,
I begged my reverend, and revered, as well as much beloved
friend, to understand, and to make it understood, that he went
as no envoy of mine, but simply at his own suggestion. “That
shall be plain enough,” he said, “he shall not even know that I
asked your leave.”</p>

<p>It must have been a strange and curious thing to see this
encounter of two men, as different as any two men can be, and
as far apart as heaven and hell. Not having been there, I
cannot describe it; and I could not have done so, if I had
been present. But from what was told me afterwards, the
result was much as follows.</p>

<p>Donovan Bulwrag received his unknown visitor politely.
He offered him a cigar, but whether in sport or courtesy was
not plain, and then he said with his usual slowness, leaning
back in his chair, and thinking—</p>

<p>“Sunbury, I think Sir Gilbert says; Sunbury a pretty
village on the river. I know it a little, but I ought to know
it better; for my mother’s family lived there. And an aunt of
mine—Miss Coldpepper—must be one of your oldest inhabitants.
But owing to family circumstances, we do not see very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
much of her. How is she? I hope she supports the Church,
as all people of property should do.”</p>

<p>“The Church requires no support”—Mr. Golightly was
always annoyed at the idea of the Church being patronized;
“except what she has from above, Mr. Bulwrag, and from the
proper zeal and gratitude of her dutiful children.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. That is exactly what I meant. I trust that
my aunt is a dutiful child. But I know with sorrow that we
do not all value our privileges, as we should. You find that
the case sometimes, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Too often, I regret to say, I do.” Mr. Golightly was always
grave with any one who spoke gravely. “But we do not
restrict the opportunities of doing good to parishioners. We
have many useful institutions in our parish. Perhaps you
would like me to mention a few. And if with your very kind
feelings towards the Church, and anxiety about your aunt’s
discharge of Christian duties, you should feel impelled to contribute,
I happen to have the subscription-lists of six of the
most meritorious, all in urgent need of funds; and I carry the
receipt-forms in my pocket.”</p>

<p>Downy was caught in his own net very neatly, and the
parson heard him mutter—“Confound that Sir Gilbert. This
is a little too bad of him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I don’t quite see. I am sure this is most kind of you—but
with the many claims upon my small resources—perhaps
it would be better to allow my mother the benefit of this
opportunity.”</p>

<p>“You must not blame Sir Gilbert. I did not come upon
a begging errand. I intrude upon you for quite a different
purpose. A sad and most mysterious thing has happened in
our parish.” Mr. Golightly watched him closely, to note the
effect of every word. “A lady newly married to an excellent
young man, of one of our oldest families, suddenly disappeared
last May, and has not since been heard of.”</p>

<p>“You need not tell me that. I know all about it,”
Bulwrag replied without any change of face, but in quite a
different tone, and speaking quickly. “I could not help
knowing it, considering that the girl’s father was my mother’s
husband. She married without our knowledge, and is gone
without it. My mother, who has been most kind to her, never
met with such ingratitude.”</p>

<p>“I do not intrude into family matters. I have nothing to
do with that part of the case. I am here simply to discharge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
my duty. I come by nobody’s suggestion. Only as the
clergyman of the parish I feel myself bound to do all I can, to
restore peace and happiness, and to right a great wrong.”</p>

<p>“It is very good on your part, and I wish you all success.
It would appear to be rather an affair for the police. I am
sorry that I have an important engagement. Would you like
to see my mother on the subject?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. My business is with you. I will speak
plainly, and as an old man to a young one. All who know of
this mysterious affair, believe that it is of your doing. Hear
me out, and without anger, as I speak. If from some ill-will to
either of those two, or for any other reason of your own, you
have contrived to part them, be satisfied now with what you
have done. For many months now, you have caused the deepest
misery, doubt, suspense, and almost despair. You have
crushed two young hearts, which perhaps never will recover.
You have desolated a simple, innocent, and tranquil home.
Remember, I beseech you, what is manly, good, and just. I
will not urge religion, because perhaps you have little sense of
it. But even so, you know how short our time is here, and
how paltry it is to injure one another. Even now, if you will
do what is right, I will pledge myself that you shall be forgiven.
Your share in it shall not be published to the world.
You will have had more revenge than the bitterest foe can long
for, and you will escape the penalty.”</p>

<p>The clergyman urged that last point, because he saw whom—or
rather what he had to deal with—a thing that could not be
called a man. For during his description of our misery, he
had detected a glow of fiendish exultation in the crafty eyes
he was observing. This proved to him more clearly than if he
had seen the deed, that the guilt lay on that brutal soul.</p>

<p>“It is a sad loss to us, my dear sir,” replied Bulwrag, looking
at him steadfastly; “that we have not the privilege of
living in your parish. Not only for the sake of the deep
interest you feel in the private affairs of your parishioners, but
also because you possess very largely that extremely rare gift—eloquence.
I should be trembling in my shoes, if I had anything
to tremble for. But knowing no more than you do, and
perhaps much less, about this strange affair, I am simply astonished
at your waste of words, and if you were not a clergyman,
I should say—your impertinence.”</p>

<p>“I have never been charged with impertinence before.
Even if I am wrong, there is nothing of that about it. But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
I have been mistaken, I have done you much wrong as a
gentleman; and I will beg your pardon, if you will do this.
Take a sheet of paper, and write these words—‘Upon my
honour as a gentleman, I have had nothing whatever to do with
the disappearance of Kitty Orchardson. Signed, Donovan
Bulwrag.’”</p>

<p>“It would be easy enough to do. But I do not choose so
to degrade myself. If you think again, you will see that you
were wrong, in proposing a thing so disgraceful. If you will
not apologize without that, I must even put up with your insult.
I believe that you are a good man, Mr. Golightly, and deeply
attached to your parish, sir; but impulsive, and hasty, and
illogical. A fault upon the right side, no doubt; but too
hasty, sir, much too hasty. I must beg you to excuse the same
fault in me—for I cannot wait another moment.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Golightly came back, he declared that but for
that glow in Bulwrag’s eyes, he could well have believed in his
innocence. For he had never known any one meet a charge,
when conscious of guilt, with such entire self-possession, and
unfaltering readiness. And he feared that there was no such
thing as mercy in his composition.</p>

<p>“He is a foe to be dreaded, Kit,” he continued, looking at
me sadly. “There is nothing, however bad, that he would
stick at; he is resolute, calm, and resourceful. I have met
with some men—not very many—in the course of my work as
a clergyman, who seemed to have forgotten and foregone all the
good, all the kind, all the tender part of the nature which God
has given us. St. Paul describes such beings—one can scarcely
call them human; and so from a different point of view does
Aristotle. It is useless to deny that they exist, although one
would like to deny it—people in whom there does not remain
one particle of good feeling to appeal to. Yet according to
memoirs of some great Christians they have been such at one
time. I will not deny it, though I have never known an instance.
It is possible that by the power of Grace such an one
may be converted and live, as a brand snatched from the burning;
but—”</p>

<p>“But I hope Bulwrag won’t be so at any rate. And I don’t
think there is much fear of it. I hope that he will have his
portion—”</p>

<p>“Hush, Kit, hush! I pray you not to imitate him. Why
is he as he is, but from indulging the evil part in early days,
and famishing the better side? But I have brought you some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
news of your father-in-law, the learned and good Professor
Fairthorn. You have looked in vain, I think, in that scientific
journal, as it seems to be called, which you took in on purpose.
I saw this quite by accident in <i>The Globe</i> as I came home; and
although it cannot help you, I thought you might like to see it.”</p>

<p>He handed me the paper, and I read as follows, among the
short paragraphs of news received that morning:—</p>

<p>“The steamship <i>Archytas</i>, as our readers may remember,
proceeded on a cruise of investigation and deep-sea soundings
last April or May, being fitted out specially for that purpose by
a well-known learned society. Our Government, with its
usual penurious system, has left all these questions of prime
importance to our commerce and intercourse with the world,
entirely to private enterprise; and we acknowledge with shame
that we never could have laid a cable across the Atlantic, without
the knowledge for which we are indebted to the broader and
more enlightened policy of the United States. Unhappily
these are now involved in an internecine struggle, which must
retard for many years the progress of civilization; and we think
that England owes a debt of gratitude to the learned association,
which has thus stepped in to man the breach by voluntary
efforts. Some uneasiness had been felt concerning the safety
of this gallant band, which is under the charge, as we need not
say, of one of our most distinguished savants, the well-known
Professor Fairthorn; for no tidings of the <i>Archytas</i> and her
gallant company had reached this country for many months.
But we are happy to announce, in advance of our contemporaries,
that the exploring ship was spoken, in latitude and
longitude not decipherable on the telegram—for it can hardly
have been 361, and 758, which are the apparent figures—by the
clipper-ship <i>Simon Pure</i>, which arrived at Liverpool last night.
The <i>Simon Pure</i> took letters from her, which will be received
with avidity, also instructions that any letters for the members
of the expedition should be addressed to Ascension Island, if
posted in Great Britain before the end of November. We hope
to give further particulars shortly.”</p>

<p>Without loss of a day, I took advantage of this opportunity,
but rather as a matter of duty, than of hope or promise. And
as my letter led to something, I will venture to insert it here,
though a very old-fashioned production.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear and respected Father-in-law,</span>—You will be
surprised and shocked to hear that shortly after your departure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
your daughter Kitty, my dear wife, left me apparently of her
own accord, without a word of explanation, or any cause that I
can even imagine. We had lived in perfect happiness and
love; no cross word had ever passed between us; instead of
growing tired of one another, we had become more and more
united. I am well aware that the home I could give her was
not such as she, with all her attractions, might have aspired to.
But she knew that, before she married me; and to all appearance
she was perfectly satisfied, and as happy and lively as the
day is long. And we had every hope, with kind friends round
us, of improving our condition from year to year. And I say,
on the honour of an Englishman, and on the faith of a Christian,
that never, in thought, word, or deed, had I wronged her, or been
untrue to her. In short, she was all my life in this world, and
I loved her even to infatuation, and fondly believed that she
loved me likewise.</p>

<p>“Yet on the evening of May 15th, 1861, when I returned
to our cottage, at the time arranged, and in full expectation of
finding my dear wife, she was gone without a single word; and
from that day to this, although I have sought, and others have
sought high and low, not a trace of her can be obtained, except
as mentioned afterwards, and not a line has come from her.</p>

<p>“It is the deepest mystery I have ever heard, or read of;
and when it will end, God only knows. She was much too
sensible, and pure, and loving, to have left me thus for any
trifle, or for the sake of any other man. Sometimes I fear the
very worst,—that she may have met with some fatal accident,
or have been decoyed away and killed. But who could do that
to my innocent Kitty? Surely not the vilest man ever born.
My suspicions rest very strongly on a person well known to you,
Donovan Bulwrag; but I cannot bring it home to him.</p>

<p>“We believe that we have traced my wife, after a search of
many weeks, to Woking Road Station on the London and South-Western
Line; but there all further clue vanishes; and we
cannot identify, or even guess at the elderly man, who appears
from our inquiries to have taken her thus far. My uncle
Cornelius Orchardson, and my aunt, Miss Parslow of Leatherhead,
have spared no pains or expense, in helping me in my
hopeless search; but nothing comes of it, and I almost despair.</p>

<p>“I need not ask you, if you know anything which can throw
any light on this horrible puzzle, to write to me immediately.
But my hopes are very faint, because you were far at sea before
it happened; as was proved by your kind message, received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
from the captain at Falmouth, which my dear Kitty read with
me, and for which I beg to thank you.</p>

<p>“With all good wishes for your success in the important
work you are engaged on, and hoping for your speedy return, I
am with all respect and love, your unfortunate son-in-law,</p>

<p class="sig">
“<span class="smcap">Kit Orchardson.</span>”<br />
</p></div>

<p>After finding out how much it would cost, I posted this
letter with my own hands; and the gloomy winter closed upon
me, with nothing but its dreary round of heavy ponderings and
lonesome work.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER LVIII.<br />

<small>UNCLE CORNY’S LOVE-TALE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">A discontented</span> and sour man,” said my Uncle Corny, one
Saturday night when I had dropped into supper, “is as likely
as not—unless he prays to God every morning of his life—to
turn into a Liberal. I have known a lot do it, and being
nabbed on the nail by the shady lot who are always near the
corners, never get any chance again to come back into honesty.
Kit, is that sort of thing going on with you?”</p>

<p>“Not likely,” I answered, for my principles were sound; “is
it likely that I would join a party including Lord Roarmore and
his grandson? Conservatives commit no outrage.”</p>

<p>My uncle considered that statement gravely. He was too
large-minded and candid of nature to accept it without the support
of fact. He was probing his memory, to see if this were
so.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said at last, “there is some truth in it, though
it seems at first sight to go a little too far. I have known
many very tranquil Radicals, and one or two Tories of an energetic
turn. All I feared was that you might be driven by the
vile wrongs you have suffered into that miserable frame of
mind, when people are hatched into Radicals. They injured
me, not quite so much as you, my lad, but bitterly, very bitterly.
Yet I carried my principles sound through it all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, you promised to tell me the story of the wrong
done to you, in your early days. I have often longed to hear
it; but was afraid to ask you, because of the trouble it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
to you. But if you could bring yourself, without feeling it
too much, to tell me how that matter was, it would be a great
satisfaction to me, and do me a lot of good, I do believe.”</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, it is a frosty night. How soon the year
comes round again; though I do not think we shall have a
winter fit to compare with the last one. But the east wind is
coming up the lane pretty sharp, and we are likely to have a
week of it. Let Tabby take the things away, and bring another
log or two. You had better come down here, if the frost goes
on. You will get frozen up there all alone.”</p>

<p>“Not I. I can keep the fire up, and I believe it is warmer
up there than here, because of the wind from the river. How
glad I am Bessy is still at Baycliff. They never feel the cold
wind there. But go ahead, uncle, according to your promise;
I don’t know how many times you have cheated me. Tabby,
look sharp, and go home before it snows now.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must put up with my in and outs. I can lay a
tree in straight enough, but I am out of my line telling things.
And you wouldn’t believe, to see me now, that I was ever a
brisk young chap, proud of the cut of his boots and breeches—for
we used to wear no long slops then—and blushing at the
mention of a pretty girl, and wondering what they were made
of. But though you would not think it now, nor anybody else,
except the young women that are dead and gone, I was quite as
much the swell of Sunbury then, as you were before you fell
into your bad luck; not so tall, of course, but I daresay quite as
strong, and the master of any lad about the village.</p>

<p>“Somehow or other, I was like you too, and your father as
well for that matter, in not making up to any damsel in the
place; although they were pretty ones then, I can tell you,
as pretty as any of the young ones now, and prettier too
to my eyes, and ever so much modester and more becoming.
But the queen of the neighbourhood, in my opinion, ay, and of
the county, too, was Myra Woodbridge, the daughter of a farmer
near Bedfont, who held land under Squire Coldpepper. If I
was to tell you what she was like, you would think I was trying
to put you out of all conceit with—with almost everybody in
the world. And her looks, although they were so sweet and
gentle, were not the best part of her, or not the only good one.
A kinder-hearted, truer-hearted maiden never lived; and you
could talk to her by the hour, without her being tired, or you
either of what she had to say.</p>

<p>“Naturally enough, all the young men round about were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
hankering after this fair maid; and it did not go against her
that her father was well off, having made a deal of money in
the great war-time, by contracts for fodder for the troops, and
so on. Myra was his favourite child, and pretty sure to come
in for a good share of his wealth some day. She could play
the piano, and sing like an angel, and talk French, and keep
accounts, and do anything. The difficulty was for me to get
near her, till I thrashed a young miller from Uxbridge who
annoyed her, and then I thrashed two other fellows who were
after her, for they never summoned people for such little
matters then; and that made her begin to think kindly of
me; and we used to walk by the brook, every Sunday evening.</p>

<p>“All was going on quite as well as I could wish, and old
Robert Woodbridge was quite coming round to the coaxing of
his lovely daughter, and the banns were to be put up just before
the grass was cut, so that we might have our wedding-day
between the hay and wheat—when suddenly everything was
thrown abroad, and both our lives were spoilt for ever.</p>

<p>“Give me the sugar, Kit; I did think I should have some
one to mix for me, in my old days—a faithful companion of
many years, or perhaps a daughter or a grandchild. But God’s
will be done. It is useless to take on.</p>

<p>“Squire Coldpepper’s daughter, Monica, the younger of the
two very handsome ladies, had taken a violent fancy to Myra;
and now, when her elder sister Arabella was carrying on,
against her father’s will, with that dashing young buck—as
they called them then—the Honourable Tom Bulwrag, Miss
Monica, who never cared much for her sister, any more than
two firebrands rubbed together, she must needs send for my
sweet Myra, to come and stay at the Hall, for some purpose of
her own, whether to plot against her sister, or be company for
herself, or what else, I cannot tell.</p>

<p>“Myra was very loth to go, for she knew the tempers she
would have to deal with, and having a right pride of her own,
she could not bear the way they treated her, partly as a friend,
and partly as a servant—for she might not have meals with
the family—and partly no doubt as a sort of go-between, or
what they call a buffer nowadays. And being a mean lot, as
everybody knows, their practice was to make her earn her keep
by sewing and doing handy jobs about the house, like a servant
without any wages. But whether she liked it or not, she must
go, for her father durst not disoblige his landlord, that peppery
Squire Nicholas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>“Unluckily, while she was in the house, that strange thing
happened that I told you of. Tom Bulwrag was to have run
away with the elder girl, Arabella; but when everything was
ready she burst out about some trifle, and I am blest if he
didn’t make off with the other; thinking, I dare say, how
sweet she was for taking his side in the shindy. It was out of
the frying-pan into the fire, and served him right, said everybody.
If the elder was a firebrand, the younger was a Fury;
and which is the worst, I should like to know?</p>

<p>“But they might have fought it out between themselves,
and no harm done to good people, if Miss Monica had not
carried Myra Woodbridge with her. She was forced to have
some one perhaps, for her own sake, little as she cared for
opinion; but one of the servants would have done as well, or
better if she had been older. How Myra allowed herself to be
taken, I could never quite understand, for it was not likely to
help her father in the good graces of his landlord. Perhaps
she thought herself in duty bound to stand by the one who
was fond of her, or perhaps she hoped to see that things came
right, and thought there might be a worse mess of it with no
one of common sense to help; at any rate she went off in the
chaise, and never had chance to come back again.</p>

<p>“You can understand what a storm there was at the Manor,
when the truth came out. Our Miss Coldpepper had been
locked up, and could not get out till they found her; and then
she was in such a state of mind, that she could not speak her
meaning clearly. The runaways had at least six hours’ start,
and it was hopeless to go after them; and in those days there
were only coaches, no railways, and no telegraphs. Squire
Nicholas swore himself into a fit; and it shortened his days, as
the doctors said, though he vowed he would live all the longer
for it.</p>

<p>“Myra was of a gentle nature, as a woman should be; yet
proud to resent any charge against her, when she knew she was
innocent. The obstinate Squire, a pig-headed man, put all the
blame upon her, or pretended to do it, to screen himself and
his own lazy ways with his daughter. Till any one who
listened to him would believe that the whole thing had been
devised and carried out by a daughter of one of his tenants.
So that when she wrote to her father—for the others left that
job to her—to say that they were all at Bath, and doing as well
as could be expected, Squire Nicholas sent a most thundering
message, through old Robert Woodbridge, that Myra had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
better never come near Bedfont, or he would have her in prison
for conspiring. Of course this was rubbish; but it frightened
the poor girl, and made her doubt what justice was.</p>

<p>“Then she wrote to me, a most pitiful letter, begging me to
think the best of her—as if I could think anything else—saying
how sorry she was for leaving home in that impulsive, foolish
way, under a mistaken view of right. Some day perhaps you
will have a letter of that sort from your Kitty. And she asked
me, as she could not ask her father (who would not forgive her
till he saw her), to oblige her by just sending money enough to
bring her back to Bedfont. ‘I came away with only half a
crown, and there is none to be got from you know who’—the
poor thing said, for she was most careful not to write names
that might lead to mischief.</p>

<p>“But like a woman, exactly like a woman, who thinks that
the whole world knows everything about her, or else is afraid
of their doing so, the only address that she gave was ‘Bath, in
the County of Somerset.’ It was hard to send money by post
in those days. You must enclose and risk it. But what was
the use of putting money in a letter directed to ‘Miss Myra
Woodbridge, Bath’? There was nothing more precise in her
letter to her father, and it took me three days to find out that,
for the old man was gone from home on business. I went to
Squire Nicholas, to see if he knew, but he only stormed at me,
and told me to go to—a place he was fitting himself for. So
that four days were lost before I could start, with your grandfather’s
leave, for the west of England.</p>

<p>“When I got to Bath, it took me two days more, as an
entire stranger in the place, to find out where the Bulwrags had
been stopping. And when I discovered their hotel at last, they
had left it on the day before, and no one could tell me what their
destination was. I came back to Sunbury in very bad spirits,
fearing greatly that I never should see my dear again.</p>

<p>“And so it turned out; although I had one more letter from
her, which was enough to break any one’s heart almost. I have
it upstairs, but I shall never show it. God only knows what a man
goes through. When my time comes, you will find it, Kit; and I
wish to have that, and the other, with me. There is more than
a twelvemonth between the two; and the second is dated from
a German city.</p>

<p>“I could not understand it at the time, because I had no
more thought of any other woman, than you have since you
lost your Kitty. Afterwards I found out the whole. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
poor girl became indispensable to them. She alone eked out
their resources, and kept them from going to the dogs, before
Bulwrag learned some roguish way of turning money. And to
keep her from quitting them and going home, they lied through
thick and thin to her, about her father and about myself, and
backed up their lies with forgeries. They vowed that her father
would never receive her; and that I was married to a Sunbury
girl. Her father could make no inquiries about her, for he had
been taken with a paralytic stroke; and her brothers, jealous
wretches, did not want her nearer home. As for me, I could
do nothing, any more than you can now. I knew that they
were all upon the Continent, and trusted in her good faith and
loyalty, for many a sad day. And although she had been
deeply hurt and wounded at my silence, which of course had
been twisted to their selfish ends, I believe that she was faithful
to me, to the very last.</p>

<p>“The old man died on the very day when I received her
second letter, and I went to his funeral with it in my pocket.
The brothers looked askance at me, and smiled a sour smile,
as much as to say—‘You don’t cut in for any of it’—and I did
not even speak to them about their sister. But they soon came
to grief, by the will of the Lord; and the farm is now occupied
by George Fletcher.</p>

<p>“In reply to that letter, which astounded me, I wrote to
say that every word she had heard was false. That I had
never forgotten her, as she supposed (although she did not
reproach me with it); that I cared for no one else, and should
never do so, and hoped from the bottom of my heart, that her
illness was not so serious as she believed. If she would only
write that she wished to see me, I would go to her anywhere
in the world. Then I told her of her poor father’s death, and
that he had loved her always, and been yearning for her. She
was on her deathbed, when she received that letter, and it
comforted her dearly, and she died with it in her hand.</p>

<p>“Now what do you think my dear girl died of? It is
almost too bad to tell you, Kit; and I can scarcely command
myself to do it. I cannot prove it. If I only could—but
vengeance belongs to the Lord in heaven. Slowly, but surely,
it will fall; and a part is already upon them. Monica Bulwrag
killed my Myra, not on the moment, but by slow death. That
was why she was so scared with you. That is the reason that
her power passes into terror, when she tries to face any of us.</p>

<p>“That scoundrel, her husband, growing tired of his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
began to pay attentions to Miss Woodbridge. He began very
craftily, for like his son, he was cunning as well as furious;
and the poor girl scarcely suspected it, or could not bring
herself to believe it true. But his wife, knowing well what he
was, saw through it; and you may suppose how her passion
raged. She came in one day when they were together, Myra
standing innocently by the window, Bulwrag gazing at her in
his vile licentious way. That woman lost all self-command, at
the sight. She strode up to Myra, and with all her weight
and strength struck her on the bosom with her clenched fist.
Myra fell backward and lay stunned upon the floor, her head
being dashed against the sill as she fell. But it was not that
which killed her; but the heavy blow on the chest, the most
dangerous part of the delicate frame.</p>

<p>“No doubt, she would have left them, if she could, though
she might have to beg her way home again; and she even left
the house, but could not get far. There had been some fatal
harm done inside, by that blow of a brute beast; and the days
of the best girl that ever lived were short in a land of strangers.
She had trouble in breathing, and some fainting fits; a good
doctor could have saved her, I do believe. But those brutes
were afraid to have medical advice, even if they desired it.
She pined away, and died. She did not care to live, until it
was too late to do it. But she died in happiness. Thank God
for that. She died with the knowledge that her father had
been her father to the last, and that I had never failed her.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, it was a bitter time for me; and my heart
was full of fury, as well as anguish. But it is arranged for us,
by a Higher Power, that these crushing strokes come upon us,
from a mist. We know not the manner of their descending,
we hope that they are not as they appear to be, we call up our
faith in Heaven’s justice to protect us, and we moan when it is
useless. Nevertheless, for all of that, I believe that truth and
equity are vindicated before we die, if only we live long
enough. And if not, let us be content. We are fitter for
another world, than those who have destroyed our life in
this.”</p>

<p>I saw that my uncle had been overdone, brave, and strong-hearted,
and stout as he was. People who complain, can
support that habit; and a habit it becomes, never touching them
inside. But he was of a hardy and courageous fibre; yet now
he leant over his long pipe-stem, and his pipe had gone out,
like the vapours of the past.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIX.<br />

<small>A COOL REQUEST.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was natural that my hatred of that heinous race should be
doubled. Violence and falsehood in the fiercer times, cunning
and falsehood in these latter days had robbed two generations
of honest growers of all that they valued most on earth. No
one, however light and careless, could help being struck with
the strange resemblance between my uncle’s sad history and my
own. It was now quite manifest why he had striven against
my affection for Kitty at first, and then when he saw that it
could not be checked, had sympathized with me in the dark
results. His wrongs must be avenged, as well as mine; and
the sweet repose of Christian contentment must not be indulged
in, till justice had been fed. The fatal point was that I could
see no way; but the way was being paved for it, without my
knowledge.</p>

<p>It was out of my power, and outside my nature, to play the
spy upon anybody; but we managed through good Mrs. Wilcox
to keep a sharp eye upon Downy Bulwrag. I rode up to see
her at least once a week, fearing above all things that he might
give me the slip, and be off to some foreign quarters, possibly
even to my darling’s prison. That she was immured in some
out-of-the-way place was now my settled conviction, and I
pondered a thousand wild plans for roaming the world at large
in search of her. The money would have been at my disposal,
for Aunt Parslow was most generous; but where to begin
was a boundless question, and where to end would have been
endless.</p>

<p>The only thing possible was to wait; and the thing most
reasonable was to hope, though impatience vowed it otherwise.
The spring came back to a heavy heart, and there was no spring
in my voice or gait.</p>

<p>One April evening I went down to the Halliford brook for
watercress for my Uncle Corny’s supper. He had not been
very well of late, and fancied this, or disliked that, in a manner
quite unusual with him. I was uneasy, and begged him daily
to seek the advice of Dr. Sippets, but he only laughed, or
bristled up, as stubborn as a rusty nail in heart of oak. Then
I told him not to smoke so much, and he replied by filling his
biggest pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>I passed the place where I first had Kitty in my arms, a
year and a half ago. Then all had been storm, and flood, and
roar. Now all was calm, and sunny silence, broken only by the
lapping of the brook. I leaned against the old carved stone,
from which she had leaped into my embrace, and the budding
shadows of the alder bush, like bars of sad music, stole over
me. It seemed to me, in my disconsolate mood, that the young
leaf had better spring back into the bud, and the flower get
quickly through its work, and die. But my thoughts were
interrupted by a grating voice.</p>

<p>“Halloa, young man, you look down in the mouth! Not
much luck for you in my house, by all accounts. Ha, that was
a scurvy trick?”</p>

<p>I answered not a word, for I disliked the man, an ill-conditioned,
evil-omened fellow—old Harker, who had meant to
live rent-free for ever in Honeysuckle Cottage. He looked
very shabby, and shaky, and uncombed, as if he slept in a hay-rick,
and washed himself with it.</p>

<p>“Ah, you wouldn’t be quite so uppish, my brave young
cock, if you knew all that I could tell you. Give my love to
old bonfire-raker. Hear he’ll come to ashes himself pretty
soon.”</p>

<p>This was so mean and ungrateful of him, after all my
uncle’s forbearance, that I seized him by the collar, as he
stepped upon the bridge, and brought him back and made him
look at me.</p>

<p>“Now, Harker, you’ll just have the kindness,” I said, “to
speak out, like a man, what your meaning is. I am not going
to hurt you, if you do the right thing. Otherwise you shall
have a wash, and not before you want it. Out with it. Out
with everything that you can tell me; though I don’t believe
there’s much of it.”</p>

<p>“Very likely not. And I would not say a word of it—such
as it is—for any fear of you; but only because he has
treated me shabby. Promised me five pounds, and only gave
me one. That wasn’t arkerate, you know. Why it hardly
paid for shoe-leather. What will you give me, Master Kit, to
tell you all I know of him, and all his tricks about you?”</p>

<p>“That depends upon what I find it worth. In the first
place, who is the he you talk of?”</p>

<p>“As if you didn’t know? Well you are a pretty muff, if
you don’t know when a man hates you. I have no love for
you, mind, because of the scurvy way I was treated; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
would not go out of my way to hurt you, without being paid
for it. What will you give? You will be glad to know it;
though I don’t promise you it will help you much. I am
always arkerate, I am.”</p>

<p>I promised him a pound, if it should prove to be of value,
or a crown if I could make no use of it; and although it could
help me but little for the future, I considered it worth the
larger sum, when I had heard the whole of it; because it
cleared up so many little points which had puzzled me up to
that moment. This man Harker, by his own confession, had
been employed for weeks to keep close watch upon us, and
report all our doings to Bulwrag. That demon discovered that
this low fellow bore a grudge against us, because of his expulsion
from the cottage; and what better spy could he wish for than
one who had lived in the place, and knew every twig and
stone? It is awful for a simple man (who lives without much
thought, and says and does everything without looking round)
to find that all his little doings have been watched, by an eye
that was anything except the eye of God. We had kept a very
distant sort of outlook upon Bulwrag; but that was different
altogether, and as a rogue he must long have been accustomed
to it. To think that in our gardens (where every tree knew
me, and the line of every shadow was known to me) I could
not even move without somebody behind me, was enough to
scatter all delight, and simplicity, and carelessness.</p>

<p>Harker told me all about the secret of the door into Love
Lane. I knew that it was bolted, I was sure it had been
bolted, I could almost swear that it had not been opened by
any honest person from the inside, for a long time before Kitty
vanished through it. It ought to have been locked as well, of
course; as Tabby Tapscott (who had the true feminine knack
of hitting a blot) observed. But now all that became plain as
a pikestaff. That sneak of a Harker knew a dodge for undoing
the bolt from the outside, by tapping on a sprung piece of
tongued board, when the bolt (which was loose in the socket)
would glide back.</p>

<p>I remembered what appeared to be a pretty turn of Kitty’s,
when I asked her to come and take a walk in Love Lane.
“Not unless you seem to want it, my dear. We have our love
inside, and it is not a gloomy lane.” For she always loved
fruit-trees, and fair alleys, and the way one looks up at the sky
through balls of gold.</p>

<p>However, that sort of thing was out of Harker’s line; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
I asked him a few questions, with a sovereign in my hand; at
which he kept glancing, as a dog of better manners assures his
master that he loves the hand ever so much more than the tit-bit
inside it. He told me—for his mind was made up now—that
he had suspected Bulwrag’s scheme, but had nothing to do
with the final stroke, except that he had opened the road for
it. I conjured him by all that he valued—if he valued anything
besides himself—to tell me where my dear wife was likely
to be now, if indeed she were in the world at all.</p>

<p>He had no fine feeling to be appealed to, and having had a
bad wife—his own fault, I dare say—could not at all enter into
my concern. But he took a great weight from my heart by
declaring that there was no fear of Kitty being made away
with.</p>

<p>“’Tis a bit of revenge, and nothing more,” he said; “the
man is so deep and slippery that you can never circumvent him.
You are a baby altogether to him. Although he employed me
for weeks together, he never let me into any one of his devices.
He never does anything as you expect it. When you find out
this, if you live long enough to do it, you will find it come
contrary to all your guesses. If you ask what I think is the
best way, I will tell you. But it might be quite wrong for all
that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, when I had asked most earnestly,
and promised him five pounds, if it turned out well; “you just
do this, and see what comes of it. Collect all your money, and
get your uncle to sell a good piece of his land for building, they
are talking of that sort of thing, you know; and there is sure
to be a railway by-and-by, and the old Topper’s land is the best
in the parish. Then when you have raised a thousand pounds,
take it in a bag, or a purse with open meshes, and lay it on his
table—not too near him, mind—and then be very humble, and
say, ‘Mr. So and So, you have beaten me out and out, and I
give in. You shall have all this, and I’ll cry quits, and give
you any undertaking you require, as soon as I get my wife
back again.’ It is my belief, Master Kit, that you would have
her in a week; for that sort of man will do anything for
money.”</p>

<p>This was altogether a new view to me, and I began to
suspect things immediately. Possibly this man had even been
sent to propose a bargain in this sly way. I could raise the
thousand pounds, by selling out what I possessed; and my
wife was worth more than all the money in the world, or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
than my own life to me. But my pride, and sense of right,
swelled against the low idea; and I knew that even Kitty
would condemn so vile a bargain.</p>

<p>“If that is the only way to do it, it will never be done,” I
answered sternly; “but tell me one thing—did you see her
go? Did you see the man who came to fetch her?”</p>

<p>“No. It was managed too well for that. They got all
they could out of me, and trusted me no further. I did not
even know that it was going to be done. I was ordered off to
Hampton, on that very day.”</p>

<p>Seeing some one in the distance coming towards us from
the village, I gave the man his sovereign, and let him go, after
learning where he might be found in case of being needed.
And before I could even think the matter over, Mrs. Marker
was crossing the planks towards me, dressed very prettily, and
smiling at me pleasantly.</p>

<p>“What memories this spot does evoke!” She had taken to
rather fine language lately, and seemed to become more and
more romantic. “Oh, Mr. Kit, Mr. Kit, is it possible that I
meet you here again? Alas, I fear that you seek this spot, to
heave the sad sigh, and to shed the briny tear.”</p>

<p>I replied that I was only come to look for watercress, but
was very glad to meet her; for we always had been friends, and
perhaps she could tell me many things I wished to know.</p>

<p>“Whatever I know is at your command. My deep and
heartfelt but unavailing pity has followed your fortunes for
many a long month. Why the bridal morn seems but yesterday,
so to speak; and yet a rolling year has passed over us since
then! Robbed of your bride in less than half the honeymoon,
and before she understood the price of sugar—you remember
that she was to have laid it in cheap, second whites before it
went up for preserving. Oh, Mr. Kit, we well may say inscrutable
are the decrees of Heaven. But all shall be well yet, all
must be well, if we trust in the Lord, and gird up our loins
with trembling. Excuse the remark if too personal, but my
heart does bleed for you. Any new light shed upon this dark
dispensation?”</p>

<p>“That is the very thing I was going to ask you. But first
of all, tell me, dear Mrs. Marker, are you convinced, are you
absolutely certain, that my Kitty would never prove false to me?”</p>

<p>I never put this question to any of my own sex. But it
always did me good to receive from a woman, who must understand
women so much better, the strong confirmation of my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
strong faith. To their credit be it said that not one of them
refused it.</p>

<p>“Fie, fie! How can you ever bring yourself to ask the
question? Though I am sure, I am not surprised, after all that
has happened. But I will tell your Kitty of it, and we will
have a laugh together. For the triumph of the wicked cannot
last much longer. I suppose you have heard what the wretch
is doing?”</p>

<p>“Not very lately. I was going to ask you. We were told
in the autumn, by a lady who seemed to know, that everything
was settled, and even the day fixed for his marriage with a very
rich young lady, the only child of a very wealthy Earl? But it
seems to hang fire, and I cannot discover that anything is
settled even now. Do tell me what you have heard of it. Miss
Coldpepper surely ought to know.”</p>

<p>“I should think she ought, considering what he has done.
It appears that the lady is quite willing; she is under some
foolish spell, and thinks him such a hero. But her father, though
he seemed to give in at first, heard something, which induced
him to change his mind. And now he insists, as is only fair,
upon something being brought in by the gentleman as well.
They are doing all they can to get over the hitch. And what
do you suppose he had the impudence to do? He came down
here about a week ago—drove down in a handsome cab all the
way; nobody was to know it of course, but I did; and then
and there he had the face to ask his aunt to declare him the
heir, and to bind herself to it, of all her estates and property.
It quite took my breath away when I heard it—that any one
should have such assurance. And after all that has happened
in the family.”</p>

<p>“A nice lord of the manor he would make. Did his mother
come down with him?”</p>

<p>“Not she. He was too wide awake for that. The sisters
can never be in one room half an hour without fighting. He
went on about the honour of the family, and adding to the
estates with the old Earl’s wealth, and taking the name of
Coldpepper, and I don’t know what else—for of course I was
not there; but she told me of it afterwards, and she laughed
very heartily I can tell you. ‘It is a mere business arrangement,’
she replied, ‘and it must be done in business form, if at
all. Write to my solicitors on the subject, proposing exactly
what you have proposed to me. Give your reasons for wishing
that it may be settled so, and add that there could have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
no occasion for it, if your mother had not run away with your
aunt’s lover, after locking her in a dark hole where she might
have died. You may be quite certain of my consent, as your
mother was, when she turned the key on me. Don’t let me
detain you, for fear of losing time. Solicitors are never very
rapid in their work.’ He could scarcely have been disappointed,
but Charles said he did look savage, when he showed him out.
And now, what do you think his next card is?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell? Perhaps he’ll come to Uncle Corny, and
ask him to sell his garden, and settle it upon him.”</p>

<p>“You are not so very far out after all. Your Kitty has a
very rich aunt in the north—no relative of his in any way, not
even a connection, for she is related to Kitty on her mother’s
side. But she has the reputation of being rather soft, and so
off he goes without telling anybody. But we heard of it; we
hear a great deal more now; because we’ve got a maid whose
sister lives there, and waits upon the two young ladies who are
always chattering about their brother; and our Mary can’t do
without her Anne, for more than a week, because they are twins.
Every Sunday our Mary goes up to the Park, or their Anne
comes down to the Manor. And perhaps you may know what
ladies’-maids are, Mr. Kit. They really seem to take a deeper
interest in the family they serve than the one they belong to.
So we know all the young ladies know, and perhaps more than
their mother knows; for being so masterful she has things kept
from her, as is only natural. And I can tell you one thing,
Mr. Kit, which you won’t be sorry to hear perhaps, or at any
rate didn’t ought to be. Mr. Downy Bulwrag is in more
trouble; not about money I mean, but something worse, or at
any rate deeper than money is. His sisters know this; but
they don’t know what it is, or else they are afraid to speak of
it.”</p>

<p>I thought of Tony Tonks, and the man called Migwell
Bengoose, who appeared to Tony to be an English sailor, fallen
into foreign ways; and I thought it very likely that he might
have brought bad news.</p>

<p>“He goes away at night,” continued Mrs. Marker, “without
a word of notice to anybody, and he sneers, or is grumpy,
if they ask him about it; and he has been seen with very
shabby-looking people, though he used to be so particular about
that. And he carries one of those new-fangled pistols, that go
off a dozen times with one load, and every one is afraid to go
near him almost, because of his temper and all that. From all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
I am told, you may depend upon it, he is not enjoying himself,
Mr. Kit, so very much more than you are. And that is not
very much, to go by your face; sorry as I am to see it, sir, after
saving me from the jaws of death.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Mrs. Marker; you saved yourself, by your
presence of mind, and a light young foot.”</p>

<p>“You say things beautifully, Mr. Kit. It was always your
gift as a child, I have heard, though not old enough here to
remember it. And now, sir, remember that you have one good
friend, who will never be happy, till you are. A feeble friend,
but a warm one, and able perhaps to do more than you think.
Nothing shall go by me that you ought to hear of. Good-bye,
sir, good-bye. Everything will come right, and you shall pay
me, for telling your fortune.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER LX.<br />

<small>ALIVE IN DEATH.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Downy Bulwrag</span> was indeed in trouble—not brought on by
his evil deeds, as good people might have imagined; or at any
rate not so caused directly, according to present knowledge,
although in the end it proved otherwise. It had seemed an
astonishing thing to me, considering his haughtiness and shrewd
perception, that he should have deigned to expose himself to
that quiet rebuff from Miss Coldpepper. And then that he had
gone upon another quest of money, even more humiliating,
showed that there must be some terrible strait, some crushing
urgency in his affairs.</p>

<p>He was not a man who lived extravagantly; he was rather
of the mean and close-fisted order, even in his self-indulgence.
From what had been said at Sam Henderson’s dinner, it would
seem that he had fallen into certain racing debts; but I could
not believe that these were crippling him, for he generally
managed to work them off, and come out with a balance in his
favour. But there was another thing in the background, of
which I had no knowledge yet; and when I speak of it now,
it must be understood that I do so from later information.</p>

<p>That account in the <i>Globe</i>, which the clergyman showed me,
had been followed by further particulars in the Journals of the
following day, and by one or two extracts from private letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
brought to England by the <i>Simon Pure</i>. But the ships had
been parted by a sudden gale, after a very brief interview, and
some despatches, which were not quite ready, had lost their
chance of delivery. There was nothing of interest to me,
except what I had seen at first; and no letter from the Captain
to my wife arrived by post, which surprised me for the moment.
But that was explained by the likelihood that he might have
been hurried with official reports, while intending to send his
private letters with them, and thus had lost the chance of
despatching either. And as any such letter must have missed
its mark, there was no great disappointment.</p>

<p>But the <i>Simon Pure</i> landed near Liverpool, as I came to
know long afterwards, an unhappy and afflicted man, welcome
to no person and to no place on the face of the habitable
globe. An elderly man of great bodily strength, and bulk
of frame, and large stature, he had better have gone beneath
the earth—as the father of poets has it—than linger on
it, lonesome, loathsome, shunned, abominated, and abhorred.</p>

<p>His sins had been many, and his merits few; he had lived for
his own coarse pleasures only; he had never done good to man,
woman, or child; yet he might have called any man worse
than himself, who refused to grieve for his awful grief—for
this man was a leper.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Simon Pure</i> was humane as well as
resolute. This Spaniard, as he called himself, had lurked
under a tarpaulin, till the boat of the <i>Archytas</i> was far away,
and the gale began to whistle through the shrouds and chains.
Then he came forth and showed himself, holding forth his
hands, defying the sailors to throw him overboard. For a
month he had been treated well by the crew of the exploring
ship, who were all picked men of some education, and ready to
listen to reason. He had managed to quit them without their
knowledge, and cast his lot among a less enlightened crew.</p>

<p>The boldest feared to touch him, but with nautical skill
they encoiled him in ropes from a distance, and were just beginning
their yo-heave-oh chant, when the captain rushed up and
dashed them right and left. With his own hand he unbound
the leper, and led him forward, and allotted him a place on the
forecastle, where none might come near him, except to bring
him food, and where he must abide, if he cared to live. His
chief desire was to get back to England, and finding himself
well on the way for that, he indulged in strange antics, and
shouted and roared, as if all the ship belonged to him. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
the moon was high—for the moon appears to have strange
power over those outcasts—the sailors were afraid to keep the
deck, with his wild songs flowing aft to them; for he had
belonged to a colony of Indian lepers, and had learned their
poetry.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship was in the Mersey, he contrived to be
quit of her. Perhaps he was afraid that his condition would
be made known to the authorities, who might find it their duty
to observe him, though they could not legally confine him. At
any rate he escaped any such trouble, by dropping into a boat,
and landing on the south side of the river. A purse had been
made for him by the sailors, not a very heavy one, for they
were short of cash, but enough to carry him to London—at
once the fountain and the cesspool of diseased humanity.</p>

<p>Donovan Bulwrag had been unable, after his recovery, to
put up with the control and order of his mother’s house in
Kensington. He had taken private rooms again, in a little
street near Berkeley Square; and though his mother was not
well pleased, she had now to contend with a will as strong as
her own, and even firmer. He must have his own way in this,
he must be indulged at every cost, rather than driven to mutiny
when all depended on him. If once he were married to Lady
Clara, all would be wealth and prosperity. She had hoped to
see it done ere now, but a wicked chance had crossed her.</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve o’clock one night, towards the end of
February; and Bulwrag, having returned from his club much
earlier than usual, was sitting by the fire in his dressing-gown,
with a cigar in his mouth and a bottle of very old Cognac on
the table. He was not in a pleasant humour, for the luck had
been against him, and foreseeing worse he had come away, for
he was growing superstitious.</p>

<p>He was dwelling gloomily on the dull necessity before him—the
“brilliant prospect,” his mother called it, but he disliked
his intended bride; and this good thing (alone perhaps) may
be said in his favour—he was not wholly mercenary. I would
fain hope, though without much faith, that he may have felt
some true regret at the cruel wrong he had done me—for verily
the expiation was nigh.</p>

<p>Suddenly the front-door bell rang sharply, and the poor
weary maid shuffled down the stairs. She had told him, when
he came in that night, that a tall strange-looking gentleman, with
his face muffled in a white cravat, had called about nine o’clock
and left word that he would come again that evening. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
given his name as “Senhor Diaz,” and Bulwrag, after wondering
vainly, concluded that it must be some one connected with
the sailor Migwell, whom he had seen in the autumn.</p>

<p>Slow heavy steps approached his door, and the maid was
dismissed with some gruff words in a foreign language quite
unknown to Donovan. Then the door was opened without a
knock, and a big man stood and looked at him.</p>

<p>“Who are you? And what do you mean by coming at this
time of night?” Bulwrag spoke in his roughest tone, for the
man was shabby and repulsive.</p>

<p>The visitor coolly took a chair, handling it in a peculiar
manner, for he seemed to have bags on, instead of gloves.
Then he crossed a pair of gigantic legs; and Bulwrag saw that
he wore no boots, but loose slops of hide with the hair on, in
size and shape much like the nosebag of a horse. His hat was
flapped over his ears and forehead, and he spoke not a word, but
gazed at Downy with large red eyes, having never a hair of lash
or brow to shade them. Bulwrag shuddered, and drew his chair
away; he had never been looked at like this, and could not
meet it.</p>

<p>“In the name of the Devil—” He could get no further;
for the eyes of this monster, and the strange formation under
the cloth, where his face should have been, declared that he
was laughing.</p>

<p>“You have learned to swear. Valedon—very good”—the
voice sounded dead through the mufflings, and the accent was
not like an Englishman’s—“chip of the old block. I was
famous for that, at your age, young man.”</p>

<p>“What do you know of my age? Who are you? What
are you? What brings you here at this time of night? What
do you want me to do for you?”</p>

<p>Even Downy Bulwrag was hurried and confused, and lost
his resources in the presence of this man; and a fearful idea
made his blood run cold.</p>

<p>“Ha, he knows me not. He is not a wise son”—the
stranger still kept his red eyes on him—“where is the voice
of nature, that I am compelled to introduce myself?”</p>

<p>“Speak out. Do you mean to stop here all night? Don’t
cover your face up, like a thief. In the name of God, who
are you?”</p>

<p>The stranger slowly uncovered his face, sliding the bandage
from his cheek-bones downward, with a clumsy movement of
his bagged hands; then he rose to his full height and stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
before the gas, and looking no longer at Bulwrag, waited to
be looked at by him. His face was transformed into that of
a lion.</p>

<p>“You must go to a hospital. Don’t come near me. Pull
it up again, for God’s sake.”</p>

<p>“It is God who has done it, if there is a God. And why
should a man be ashamed of it? Embrace your father—as the
Frenchmen say—in a few years you will be like him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t come near me, I tell you again. I have a revolver
in this drawer; none of your pop-guns, but a heavy bullet. I
don’t want to hurt you, if you will only go away.”</p>

<p>“My son, I do not intend to go away. It grieves me to
hear you speak of it. Surely you never would cast off your
father, for such a sweet trifle as leprosy.”</p>

<p>Bulwrag began to recover himself, which was more than
most men of his years would have done. Nature had not
endowed him with the largest head in London, without putting
something inside it. His sitting-room was small and plainly
furnished, but having been used by convivial men, it possessed
a long table (now set against the wall) which would slide out
to still greater length with levers. He drew this across the
room, extended it, and closed the gap at the end with the one
in common use. Then he threw up the window at his side of
the room, after fastening back the curtains, and requested his
visitor to throw up the other; for the house was a corner one,
and the room had “cross-lights.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t do it, my son. Would you like to see my
hands? No? Very well, you must take them upon trust. I
have three fingers left, but the spot is upon them. However,
you are a brave fellow, so far, though infected with popular
ignorance. Nine out of ten would have rushed away, shouting
‘Murder!’ But you may put away your shooting-irons, as
the Yankees call them. A hole in my body does more good
than harm, under the circumstances. Once for all, my complaint
is not contagious, or at any rate not among well-fed
people; and you are well-fed, if ever anybody was. Give me
a cigar; you will do that gladly for your own interest, I dare
say. I can smoke it with my bandage on. Now a glass of
good brandy—no water with it. You may break the glass
afterwards, if you think proper, as the fools did on board the
<i>Simon Pure</i>; but never in the <i>Archytas</i>. Ah, that was a ship
of science!”</p>

<p>“The <i>Archytas</i>? Do you mean to say you have been in her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>“Without her and her glorious captain, my son, you would
never have seen your beloved parent. And more than that, if
there had not been a beautiful young lady on board that ship,
I should never have been here. Ah, you may well be surprised
to see me. If ever any man has been knocked about—seventeen
wounds I could count, till this affair took five away.
And one of them laid me five years by the heels, laid me under
ground, it was said everywhere. I suppose you heard that I
was dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and on very good authority too. But I was too
young to know much about it. Do you know what has
happened in the family?”</p>

<p>“Ah, the Spaniards are the men for proverbs. ‘Believe
no man dead till he comes and proves it.’ But women can always
believe what they wish. Curse the woman, she has caused all my
troubles. But wait a little longer.”</p>

<p>The deep thick voice, and the glare of his father’s eyes,
made Downy tremble. “Surely you will not—in this condition—you
will go to a hospital and get cured—you will leave
the management of things to me.”</p>

<p>“Will I? No doctor in the world can cure me, or lengthen
the months of my rotting away. And I got it by goodness, I
took it by goodness. If I had stuck to my nature, I should
have been sound. No more goodness for me in this world, and
none in the next. Can a leper go to heaven?”</p>

<p>For a while they sat silent, the old man puffing his smoke
through his muffler, and lifting the glass between his great
wrists every now and then; the young man absorbed in this
awful puzzle, with his vast head drooping on his breast. It
had never even crossed his mind to ask whether this man
might be an impostor. He felt that every word was true;
and now what possible course remained for him? At length
his father spoke again.</p>

<p>“Come, cheer up, my hearty, as the sailors said to me,
though they took care to say it a long way off. You don’t
seem delighted to have found a father, and a man of such renown
and rank. Why, I am the Marquis of Torobelle, and
you are the heir to the title. Lord Roarmore doesn’t sound
much after that. But alas, I have nothing to keep up the title,
and I dropped it among the Indians. I shall have to trouble
you a little in that way; one cannot live on glory. Oh, but
they treated me infamously, when I could do no more for them.
They drove me across the Rio Negro into Patagonia, and paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
a tribe of the wandering Indians never to let me back again.
They passed me on to the Moluches, and I tried to make my
escape from them, but was caught and left for dead again, till
a woman took pity on me. Then I married her, and lived on
putrid fish with a roving horde of the Eastern tribes, in a
miserable country, where no white man goes. Then I took
the disease from the diet and the nursing of my poor woman
in her illness, and for five years I was shut up in the leper’s
den—as they called a reeking peninsula, which explorers know
as Saint Jacob; at the back of a place called the Bottomless
Pit. There was no getting out; there were thirty of us, sometimes
more, and sometimes less, sometimes we got victuals,
and sometimes we starved, and I was the only white man
there.</p>

<p>“Although we were quite close to the sea, and almost
surrounded by it, we were far away from all chance
of ships, on a desolate, barbarous coast in a curve a
hundred leagues out of the line of traffic. And there I must
have wasted into a sandy skeleton, for there was no possibility
of escape inland, unless a good angel had been sent to fetch me.
For the ship was taking soundings, or something of the
sort, having come far away from the usual course, to
find the truth about the bottomless gulf; and all I could do
would have gone for nothing, except for that young lady.
They were giving us a wide berth, as if we all were savages,
when luckily for me she brought her spy-glass to bear, and
declared that she saw a white man among the rest. The
others laughed at her, for you may be pretty sure that there
was not much white about me just then; but she stuck to it,
and ran for the Captain, and insisted that a boat should be
sent to see about it. Oh, I could worship that girl, I could;
though it isn’t much good to me, after all.</p>

<p>“Come, you ought to say you will take care that it is,
and devote all your days and your money to the welfare of your
persecuted parent. You must have expected me long ago, or
at any rate had some hopes of it, for I sent you a message several
years ago, and some documents too from Mendoza, before I was
banished finally. A knockabout fellow swore to find out all
about you, and deliver them the next time he was in London.
Do you mean to say he has never done it?”</p>

<p>“Not till last autumn; and it was so old, I thought
nothing more would come of it. A sort of half Englishman,
half Spaniard. But a faithful fellow, and thought wonders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
you. When he first came with your message, he got into a
scrape before he could deliver it. He stabbed a man at the
Docks, and had to bolt again, and he fought shy of
London for years after that. But to see you like this
was the last thing I could dream of. You said not a word of
this in your letter.”</p>

<p>“Because I had not got it then. I took it from misery
and starvation, and living among the savages. Ah, I have
seen a good deal of the world, and met with some wonderful
people. How small even London seems to me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say; and how small the world is! You could
tell many a tale no doubt, but none more wonderful than your
own. Do you know who it was that fetched you off—the
Captain of the <i>Archytas</i>?”</p>

<p>“Give me more brandy. It is good enough for that.” The
great stranger shook himself—though he might have had more
manners—and his clothes rattled round him like mildewed
pea-pods. “I knew nothing about it at the time, of course;
but since I came here I know everything. Why it was the
man who stepped into my shoes, and a devilish sight too good
to do it. Ah, he has had his hair combed, once or twice, I
doubt. Better almost have turned leper at once. How good
he was to me! No haughty airs, no shudders, no ‘keep your
distance, dog!’ He was not at all sure of contagion, till he
looked at his books in the cabin. But it made no difference
to him. He could not tell who I was; he took me for a
Spaniard—‘Diaz’ was the name I went by—but he treated
me as a Christian, as Christ himself would have treated me.”</p>

<p>The poor man lifted his hat as he spoke, from his naked
yellow head, and the glare of his eyes was clouded. The
power to weep was gone, but not the power of things that move
to it.</p>

<p>“And he did a good work for himself,” he resumed, looking
fiercely again at Downy; “he did himself a better turn than me,
without knowing anything about it. Every one of my troubles
has been through that woman. She never knew what a man’s
wife is. She wanted to be man and woman too. The Pulcho
Indians would have taught her something. Top-knot come
down. Your husband is a leper, and the man you have eaten
up for years goes free. I am only waiting till the proper time
comes. I have had a fine time of it; and so shall she.”</p>

<p>“But I suppose you don’t want to hurt your children;”
Donovan spoke in a surly voice, for he saw that this man was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
not one to be soothed; “what harm have your children ever
done you? By appearing now you would simply starve us;
and what could we do to help you then? You have
been in London for weeks, I dare say, and you have learned
all you could about us. Did you learn that we are living in
Fairthorn’s house, and on Fairthorn’s money? And what
becomes of that, when you turn up? Did you learn that I
am likely to marry a lady of great wealth and good position?
What becomes of that if you turn up? You have not let my
mother know a word as yet?”</p>

<p>“Not I. Not a syllable yet, my son. What a strange thing
it seems to have a son again! No, I don’t want to hurt you,
or the two girls either. I have managed to get a look at them.
How they would have stared, if they had guessed it. I consider
them to be a credit to me, and I hope they are better
than their mother. And you are a credit in a certain way—a
strong, plain-spoken fellow. Not much humbug about you, I
should say. And of course, I can’t expect much affection.
But I dare say you are sorry about your poor father.”</p>

<p>“Father, I am. I am broken down about you. I have
always thought well of you, and made allowance for you.”</p>

<p>“God knows that I have wanted it, my son. I will do all
I can to help you now. I will live in some hole, and not show
myself, for a time. But only for a time, mind you. My
revenge I will have, when it can’t hurt you so much. But you
must give me money, to support me till that day. What will
you pay, and how long will you want?”</p>

<p>“Three months, perhaps four; and pay two pounds a week.
It is all I can afford, for I am awfully hard up. After my
marriage, five pounds, if you like. Give me your address.
You can have two weeks’ money now. It is all I have by me.
But don’t come here again; these people are very suspicious.
I will arrange to meet you somewhere.”</p>

<p>The poor cripple managed to take the money, and after a
few more words departed. Then Bulwrag flung the other
window up, cast the tumbler out of it, and lighted some pastilles.
Then he took a draught of brandy neat, and went
upstairs to sit in his bedroom, and brood over this calamity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXI.<br />

<small>ZINKA.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all those things I had no knowledge, till it came upon me
suddenly; except that I heard from time to time, both through
Mrs. Marker and Mrs. Wilcox, and even Miss Coldpepper, that
Donovan Bulwrag was going on strangely, and no one could
understand him. He was in such a state of mind that even
his mother feared to cross him, and his sisters were afraid to
ask him anything about it. And no one could tell what his
motive was; but all agreed that he was now as anxious to
marry Lady Clara, as he had been careless about it last year.
This—as so often seems to happen—diminished the ardour of
the other side, and the Earl insisted more and more that he
should bring something solid into settlement. The estates of
his grandfather, Lord Roarmore, were evidently encumbered,
and that ancient nobleman himself, now approaching his
ninetieth year, was almost incapable of business.</p>

<p>Though I had been terribly afflicted for a year, without the
satisfaction of deserving it, there was one thing beyond denial,
to wit that I had met with most wonderful kindness from
friends, and neighbours, and the world at large. If any one
says to me henceforth that there is no such thing as good feeling,
or good will, and that everything is selfishness, I shall tell
him that he judges all his neighbours by himself, and I wish
to hear no more of him.</p>

<p>And now when the fatal day came round, which would fill
up the twelvemonth of my misery, no less than six people were
thoughtful enough to give me the offer of being from home,
when it must be a bitter home to me. Uncle Corny, Aunt Parslow,
and Mr. Golightly, Sam Henderson, and Mrs. Wilcox, and Widow
Cutthumb, all entreated me to come to them, if I did nothing
more than hear them talk. Mrs. Marker, if she had lived in
her own house, would have added her invitation; and Mr.
Rasp the baker—though now getting on, almost beyond
recognition—got his wife to write to me, and say that they
would have a little card-party in the evening.</p>

<p>But there were too many young ladies there for me, to be
seen in the shop behind jam-pots, in a style we could never
enter into; and if I had meant to go to any place at all, that
would have been the last of them, because I should have felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
what Kitty would be thinking—“Well, he does enjoy himself,
without me!”</p>

<p>“Come to the Derby,” Sam Henderson said, meaning it all
for my good, no doubt; “and see old Chalks win with <i>Nutmeg-grater</i>.
He is at 40 to 1—makes it all the surer—the finest foal
my old <i>Cinnaminta</i> ever threw. Quite a moral, my son; I shall
make four thou. Get on, while you can. Kept him dark as
night. Tony came sniffing, but we gave him snuff. Before the
flag falls, he will be at 4 to 1. Invest, my son, invest, if you
wish to tool your Kitty in a four-in-hand.”</p>

<p>“Sam, you are up, or you would not talk so.” He saw that
he should not have said it, and was dashed.</p>

<p>“Well, old fellow, I beg your pardon. But as sure as a
horse has got four legs, you will have her back again within four
months. Lay you ten to one, in fivers.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I would bet about a thing like that? Sam
you are a good friend; but this is not like you.”</p>

<p>“Only wanted to keep your pecker up. The pluckiest fellow
gets in the dumps sometimes. Never take it crusty, when
a cove means well. Sorry you won’t come to us to-morrow.
Sally gives a rare spread at nine o’clock. But every man knows
his own ways best. I shall look you up, on my way home.
Expect to have some news, but won’t bother you till then.
Good news, fine news for you, Kit.”</p>

<p>He spoke to his glassy little nag, and was off, before I could
ask him what he meant. And I said to myself that it could
only be some nonsense, to keep my spirits up.</p>

<p>The day of my trouble, the 15th of May, happened to be the
Derby day that year, and our quiet little village was disturbed
with joy. Every one who could raise a pair of shafts, or
even of shanks, was agog right early, and I heard their shouts over
my uncle’s wall, while they set forth as merry as Londoners.
I resolved not to leave my work all day, except for a crust of
bread and cheese, that there might be no room and no time for
moping, which sits on our laps when we cross our legs. But
when it grew dark, and I went home alone, I tried in vain to
whistle, and my heart felt very low.</p>

<p>What was the use of keeping up? It was only a sham and
a self-deceit. Ten years were as likely to go by as one, without
bringing any consolation to me. All the prime of my life must
pass in sorrow, empty, mysterious, lonely sorrow. Perhaps when
I grew old and could care for no one, having no one to care for
me, when it mattered very little how my life was to finish, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
matter might be cleared up, all too late. Even my uncle
Corny’s trouble, heavy, incurable, and life-long as it was, seemed
light in comparison with mine; because all its history was manifest,
and all suspense was over. How much longer must this
misery drag on? If my Kitty were not dead, she must have
come back long ago. Or perhaps she had forgotten me and
married some low villain.</p>

<p>“<i>Nutmeg-grater, Nutmeg-grater, Nutmeg-grater</i>, for ever!”
Two merry fellows were shouting for their lives, as they
walked in wavering latitudes among the flowering pear-trees.</p>

<p>“Let me tell him.” “No, I’ll tell him.” “What do you
know about it?” “Why you never saw him in your life.”
My heart gave a jump, for I thought it must be some grand
news, by this fuss about it.</p>

<p>“Right you are, Kit. Right you shall be. <i>Nutmeg-grater</i>,
and Kit for ever!” they shouted as they saw me sitting in the
dusk, on a big flower-pot outside my door. “Shake hands, old
fellow; shake hands, here he is. He knows all about it.
Major Monkhouse, let me introduce you. Mr. Kit Orchardson,
Major Monkhouse, the two best fellows in the world together,
and <i>Nutmeg-grater</i> is the third.”</p>

<p>I saw that Sam was a little in advance of his usual state, and
the Major not behind him. They were flourishing their hats,
full of skeleton dolls, and striking attitudes, and spinning
round now and then against each other.</p>

<p>“What are you come to tell me, gentlemen? Is it about the
race?” I asked, trembling to think it must be something more.</p>

<p>“The race be d——d!” cried Major Monkhouse, one of the
most courteous of men, when sober, as I discovered afterwards.
“As between man and man, sir; as between man and man, you
know—”</p>

<p>“The Major’s hat is full of money,” said Sam, as if his own
were empty; “when that is the case, a confounded good
fellow is better than ever, sir—better than ever.”</p>

<p>“Shake hands,” the Major shouted; “Sam, shake hands!”
And he took mine by mistake, but it made no difference.
“You have such a manner of expressing what you call it—equal
honour to his hands and head. This gentleman must not
mistake my meaning. Mr. Archerson, excuse me, you understand
my sentiments. You might ride him, sir, with a daisy-chain.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, gentlemen.” I was trying to be patient, and
thought that the safest position for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a drop, Kit, not a drop, my good fellow. I am all but
a total abstainer now. And as for the Major, why, his doctor
tells him—”</p>

<p>“No good, sir, no good at all. ‘Dr. Bangs,’ I says, ‘you
may be right; but you don’t catch me taking any of your confounded
stim—shim—shimmulers.’ Sam knows how hard he
tried; but it wouldn’t do, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you were come to tell me something. I thought
you came out of your way on purpose—something of importance
to me?”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Kit, right as usual. There never was
such a boy to hit the mark. Set you up, Kit, set you on your
legs again—no more poking, no more potting, no more pottering
under a wall, no more shirking the Derby—mind you, a d——d
ungentlemanly thing to do. Why we wouldn’t have known it
but for that!”</p>

<p>“Never should have seen her, without that,” said Major
Monkhouse, solemnly; “put away too secretly among the
lost tribes. Ah, she is a stunning woman!”</p>

<p>“Now will you tell me what you mean?” I felt that I
should like to knock their tipsy heads together; “this may be a
very fine joke to you. But no excitement excuses it.”</p>

<p>“Excitement! Cool as a cucumber, sir;” cried the Major,
with a countenance by no means cool, “I should like to know
what you mean by that insinuation.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me, Major; leave it all to me. Our friend
Kit is a little hasty,” said Henderson, whispering to me—“Don’t
mind him, a very grand fellow—but has had too much.
Major Monkhouse, it is our place to make every allowance for
married men. They never know very well what they are about.”</p>

<p>“By George, sir, you are right. Mr. Archerson, shake
hands. I honour you for your integrity, sir. Sorry for you,
very sorry, and apologize with candour. Every Englishman
adds to his self-respect by that.”</p>

<p>“How he puts things! It comes of being in the Army.
Now go to sleep, Major, it will do you a lot of good, while I
tell friend Kit all we have been doing for him.”</p>

<p>By this time my hopes were reduced to proper level, and I
had ceased to glance through the trees behind them, in search
of somebody who might never come again. For these two men
had come in with such a flourish, that the wildest ideas ran
through me.</p>

<p>“A drop of ice-cold water from your pump,” said Sam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
“and then I’ll tell you something that will please you. My
coppers are hot, because I have taken next to nothing; and the
dust—you should have seen it! You have heard of the
celebrated Zinka, haven’t you, the most wonderful creature that
was ever born? Well, my dear friend there, the very finest
fellow that ever stepped this earth, sir—don’t deny it, Major,
but go to by-by—I met him at the corner on Monday, Kit;
and old Pots was there, and that made me talk of you. ‘Tell
you what,’ he says, ‘let us see the great Zinka. She can’t
help being there on Wednesday. It is the only day in the
year you can catch her; but the stars always bring her to the
Derby. If he won’t come, you bring something of his, something
he has worn, or had about him. If it is bad news, why we need
not tell him, and if it is good, why it will be new life to him.”</p>

<p>“Of course I jumped at it, and it shows what a fool I am
that it had never occurred to me. Zinka is the queen of all the
gipsies, although she is only five and twenty, the most beautiful
woman on the face of the earth. Don’t tell Sally that I said
so. Why she is Cinnaminta’s daughter, that my old mare is
named from. So you may suppose that she knows everything.
If we could only get her to spot the winners for us—but she
won’t, she wouldn’t for a hundred thousand pounds.</p>

<p>“Well, I prigged your handkerchief yesterday, my boy. No
professional could have done it neater; and a queer thing it
was that it should be your wife’s with her maiden name done in
her own hair. Nothing could be luckier, and we had a rare
laugh at it. Zinka was on the downs, not like a common
gipsy, but half a mile away towards Preston, in a beautiful
tent of her own, for she never mixes with the common ruck.
It takes an introduction, I can tell you, and a good one too, to
get a word from her. But the Major managed that, for he
knows something of her people. There is no flummery about
her. You cross her hand with a five pound note, and a crown-piece
in it, and you tell her what you want, and whatever you
give her to hold she keeps.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that a dirty Gipsy woman has got
one of my Kitty’s pocket-handkerchiefs?”</p>

<p>“Dirty Gipsy woman! She’s as clean as any queen; and
for majesty and breed—oh, I wish you could have seen her. A
thoroughbred filly three years old is more graceful than any
woman that ever stepped. You can’t expect two legs to go as
well as four, you know. But Zinka—well, to see Sally walk
after that! And Sally ain’t clumsy in her paces, neither. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
what do you think she said? When we had told her all about
it, she shut her great eyes for a minute, and her lashes came
down to the brown roses on her cheeks, and then she whispered—</p>

<p>“‘I can see a great ship coming over the sea, no smoke to
it, only white white sails. And in the front of it I can see a
beautiful young woman, looking towards England with tears in
her eyes. The ship is sailing fast, but her heart is flying faster;
and she never looks back, and answers no one, only to ask how
much longer it will be.’</p>

<p>“‘And how much longer will it be?’ we both asked her,
because it was the very thing that you would want to know.</p>

<p>“‘I cannot say, perhaps three, four weeks. The sun is very
hot, and there is a black cloud before them. Perhaps it will
swallow them up; I cannot tell. No there is a great bird with
long white wings; it will take them through the cloud, and
they will be safe. There, it is all sliding from me, like a mist!
But I can see her eyes still, and they are full of tears and smiles.’</p>

<p>“Not another word could we get out of her, Kit. There
were tears on her own cheeks, when she opened her eyes, and
she did not know a single word she had been saying.”</p>

<p>“I wish you had asked her where the ship was to land,
and what was the name of it, and how she came there, and
whether it would be any good for me to go to meet it, and who
it was the lady was thinking of all the while, and how long the
storm that was before them was to last, and whether the people
on board—”</p>

<p>“Come, Kit, that is all the thanks we get. Major, do you
hear him? No, the chap is fast asleep. Between you and me,
Kit, he has had a drop too much. But a man in a small way
doesn’t win five hundred, every day of his life, you know. By-the-way,
I heard that Downy was hard hit again. But Pots
took my tip, and has pocketed a thousand. Why, you never
congratulated me, my boy. I shall throw up the book now, and
invest it in my place. But we must be off, or Sally will blow
up. Such a spread! You had better come. <i>Cinny</i> walks into
the dining-room, and drinks a bottle of champagne, and there
will be some rattling good chaps there.”</p>

<p>“There may be a thousand, Sam; but none better than
yourself. I congratulate and thank you, Sam, with all my
heart. Few fellows would have thought of a friend at such a
time. But excuse me; I can’t come to-night, indeed I can’t.
I want to think of this all by myself. You say that this
beautiful queen is never wrong. And what a heart she must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
have, what a fine heart, Sam! I should like to have seen the
tears on her lovely cheeks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say! Come, come, Kit. But she has never been
known to be wrong, my dear fellow. All the tribe call her—well,
I can’t pronounce the name, but it means something like
‘the infallible divine.’ And she does it all so simply! There
is no humbug about her. Come along, Major; why, you must
be starved.”</p>

<p>I was partly ashamed of my own superstition; yet I could
not help saying to myself—“They believe it; and they are
ten times cleverer than I shall ever be.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXII.<br />

<small>HASTE TO THE WEDDING.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Things</span> were not going very smoothly now with Mr. Donovan
Bulwrag. Three of the four months allowed him by his
father had passed already; yet no date was fixed, or seemed
likely to be fixed, for the great event which was to make a
wealthy man of him. The old man was urgent, and could not
be brought to postpone his revenge to the convenience of his
son, for he had learned already that this chip of the old block
was of a grain quite as crooked and cross-fibred as his own. His
violent and vindictive heart was burning for the day when he
should trample on the pride of the woman who had been his
ruin, and had married again and lived in luxury, while putrid
fish was his diet. Neither was revenge his only motive.
Some provision must be made for him, something better than
two pounds a week, and a wretched den in London, as soon as
ever he chose to apply to his aged father’s men of business;
and this he could not do (without upsetting all his plans) until
he had revealed himself to that haughty woman.</p>

<p>“If you choose to make your own son a beggar, and to
turn your daughters into the streets—you must. That is all I
can say. I can do no more. I lost a lot of money to-day, all
through you. I should never have invested sixpence, but for
you. It does seem a little too hard upon a fellow, when he is
doing all he knows to please a man who never helped him.”</p>

<p>It was on the night of the Derby day, and father and son
were holding their usual weekly interview in the Green Park.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
The older man was much better dressed and cleaner than he
had been; but the other kept at a prudent distance, and took
care to smoke throughout the time. He had looked into books,
and found that the disorder is sometimes contagious, and sometimes
not.</p>

<p>“Whose fault is it that I have never helped you?” the
cripple asked disdainfully. “Don’t walk so fast; my feet are
not like yours. You make me even pay for my cab both ways.
I came to please you. You shall pay for my cab. And you
shall pay for it a little further too. I demand to be established
on the premises. You have plenty of room; and as
you said once, it can be done without any one the wiser. How
can I tell that she won’t run away, the moment you are married?
And I want to be where I can see my daughters. In a lonely
rambling, ramshackle house like that, you could put me up
easily. Why, I saw the very place, when I went round there
after dark. Who ever goes near the Captain’s workshops?
Three of them quite away from all the other rooms. I only
want one, and I will have it. It would save me ten shillings
a week, as well as cab fare. They won’t take me anywhere, in
the vilest den, for less than that, when they see what I am.
Christian country isn’t it? Why, the Pulcho Indians are
better Christians than you are. Get that room ready by this
day week.”</p>

<p>“If I do, you must give me another month’s grace. It
will be a terrible risk to take. Every one watches us so about
there; we have gained such a reputation.”</p>

<p>“And I shall increase it, my son, as soon as known. Your
mother never cared what was thought of her by any one. She
will now have a fine case to defy the public with. I go into
that room, this day week. My goods are not as manifold as
they were. I had twelve horses at my command at San Luis.
Ah, we all have our ups and downs. I am on the up scale
now.”</p>

<p>Downy was very loth to receive his father so. He knew
that it might be done safely enough, if the old man would only
be cautious and discreet. But that was the very point he
was sure to fail in. He would have been a great man by this
time, perhaps a Dictator of three sprawling States, if his prudence
had been equal to his strong will and valour. Some day
his history may be written; and if it should be done with any
skill, the reader will be likely to conclude that he has come
across yet another instance of good material thrown away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” said the dutiful son; “why can’t you
stay where you are, till it is over?” That is to say, his own
wedding-day.</p>

<p>“Because I believe that you will make her bolt. At least,
nobody can make her do anything unless she chooses. But if
she heard of me, she would bolt like a shot. And a nice fool
I should be after that. It is no good arguing. In I go, this
day week; or else I leave my card at the front door.”</p>

<p>Donovan Bulwrag contended vainly. His father was as
stubborn as himself, and a hundred-fold as reckless. What had
this afflicted mortal to be afraid of now? His sense of paternity
must have been strong, and the staple of his nature something
better than hardware, that he should have lain still so long in
his misery, poverty, and ignominy, rather than assert himself,
and shock the public, and destroy his son’s last hope of high
position.</p>

<p>Downy showed more than his usual craft, in this difficult
crisis of his fortunes. He extorted from his father, before he
let him in, a pledge that he would keep himself out of sight,
and never move without his leave, for at least another month.
The room in which he stored him was cold, and dark, and damp,
and entirely out of view from all the people of the house; yet
quite like a palace to the poor old man, after all the low dens he
had been lurking in. He was smuggled in at night, and had
to wait upon himself, receiving all his food from his son’s hands
alone. The window had been fitted with dark wooden blinds,
for some of the Professor’s experiments, and the obscurity was
deepened by the great ilex tree.</p>

<p>The Earl of Clerinhouse, though one of the wealthiest men
of the day, lived a very quiet life. His health was not strong,
and he hated all display, and had no turn for sporting, or
gambling, or politics, or any other form of noise and push. He
cared not for books, or art, or agriculture, or women, or the
drama, or the pleasures of the table. He was satisfied to take
the world as he found it, and to keep himself out of it, whenever
he could. Not for the sake of saving money, for no one
could charge him with avarice; and when he saw good to be
done, he did it in the most generous and even lavish style.
The few who knew him intimately loved him deeply for his
gentleness, simplicity, and good will; and often it was said of
him, and not untruly, that he had never spoken harshly to any
human being.</p>

<p>His father had been a great city man, keen, energetic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
enterprising; but though the present Earl retained his interest
in great houses founded by his father, he never concerned himself
about the money-market, and entered into no speculations.
The one ray of romance in his quiet life had fallen across it
when he was quite young. When the bright suns of Sunbury
were in their zenith, he had been dazzled and smitten for a
while by the lustre of Miss Monica. Happily for him, his suit
was vain; he had too little “go” in him to suit her taste; and
he married a lady better fitted for him, who left him a widower
with one daughter. But the arrogant beauty retained and
asserted—when it became of importance to her—a certain
strange influence upon his tranquil mind.</p>

<p>He had never liked Donovan Bulwrag, and shrank from
entrusting his treasure to him. For his daughter Clara was the
treasure of his life, the only object for which he cared to preserve
his feeble vitality. Lady Clara, now in her twentieth
year, resembled her father almost too closely. She was gentle,
simple, and unpretending, apt to think the best of everybody,
and to yield to a will more robust than her own. She was
likely to make a most admirable wife for a strong and good man,
who would cherish her; but with a coarse, unfeeling husband,
she was certain to pine away and die; for her mind was very
sensitive, and her constitution weak.</p>

<p>Seeing little of the world, and knowing less about it, this
graceful and elegant girl had been induced, partly by the
mother’s heroic commendations, to fix her affections upon
Downy Bulwrag. How any girl could like that fellow it is hard
to say; there was something so disgusting in his countenance to
me, and his slow, deliberate, sarcastic speech, as if he thought
over every word he uttered, and passed it through his mind to
make it nasty. However, she considered him a hero; and so
he was—a hero of cold cunning, and hot wickedness.</p>

<p>“You have at him, and I will have at her,” said this hero
to his mother, as they drove to Berkeley Square; “it can’t go
on like this. Why, I scarcely dare go out. Why, the fellows
at the <i>Fan-tail</i> were talking all about me, when I dropped in
for an hour last night. I knew it by the way they began
about the weather, and that ass of a Grogan whispered—‘Hush!
here he is.’ I shall tell her I am off to Nova Zembla next
week; and you lay it on thick about what Dr. Medley said.
Work the old muff upon that tack, and about the feeble heart-action,
and the nervous system, and all that stuff. But let me
have the little doll all to myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fairthorn sighed, for she had quick perception, and
some good behind all her badness. “I fear that the little
doll is too good for you,” she answered; and he smiled at her.</p>

<p>How they managed it, matters little; but they thought they
had managed it rarely well. No doubt they told lies pat as
puddings, and plentiful as blackberries. Tho Lord, who
settles all things well—as we sometimes find out in the end—allowed
them this little bit of triumph, to increase their discomfiture.
But after all, I have no ill will, and am sorry that they
had so much.</p>

<p>“How beautifully everything has gone off, Don!” said the
lady, when she had settled her stately form in the watered silk
again; “you see what a little tact can do. I put it as a favour
to that poor thing. The objections have come from those
wretched lawyers. The poor Earl would not hear a word about
the money. I can’t think what I have been about, not to take
the bull by the horns long ago. But the fault was yours. I
could never trust you. Well, I was never more pleased in my
life. It will be in the <i>Morning Post</i> to-morrow. Did you
see how the poor Earl looked at me? I can wind him round my
finger.”</p>

<p>“The Professor may go to the bottom with his trawl; and
then who knows what might happen?” Donovan spoke with
a bitter smile; he had never entirely forgiven his mother for
her second marriage.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so shocking, Don. I am ashamed of you. Well,
a month is not very long to wait; and there is a great deal to
see to. Fizzy and Jerry will be bridesmaids, of course, and I
must not be quite a dowdy. How that pest of a Dulcamara
will ko-tow! She threatened me with the Queen’s Bench
yesterday. I am not sure that I shall give her any order. I
should like to break her heart, and I know how to do it. If I
put the whole into Madame Fripré’s hands, Dulcamara would
never look up again. But her cut is so inferior to Dulcamara’s.
Well, I need not make my mind up, until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I think you had better keep the whole thing quiet, and
pull it off without any fuss at all. The Earl hates pomps and
vanities, so does Clara, and so do I. We had better have no
humbug.”</p>

<p>“And be married at a registry office, I suppose. None of
that mean, shabby work for me. Everything shall be left in
my hands, and I’ll see that things are done properly. If it was
only to vex your Aunt Arabella, after her trumpery rudeness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
you, I should insist upon decency and comfort. I know how to
cut her to the heart, and I intend to do it. The very day
before the wedding, I shall write—‘Dearest Arabella,—We have
been disappointed at the last moment by the dear Duchess of
Coventry. Her Grace is afflicted with a bilious attack. Would
you mind taking her place to-morrow, and excuse the brevity
of this invitation?’ I should like to see her passionate face,
when she gets that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, mother. You know, after all, you and I
are the proper heirs to her estates, though she can dispose of
them as she likes. She dislikes us; but she is an upright
woman. It would be mad to offend her fatally.”</p>

<p>“She has cheated me out of house and land. There is no
primogeniture among women. I simply did the thing she was
going to do. She has rolled in money, and let me roll in the
dirt. None of her posthumous benevolence for me! You will
never see me grovelling at that woman’s feet.”</p>

<p>At the rehearsal of her wrongs, her violent temper rose and
swelled, as a dog’s wrath waxes with his own bark. She stood
up in the carriage, and crushed her head dress. This doubled
her fury, and she turned upon her son.</p>

<p>“And you—I should like to know what you are doing in
my house—my house, if you please, not yours. You think I
know nothing about it, do you? No more of it! From this very
hour, you drop your disgraceful bachelor ways, or I fetch the
police and rout out those rooms. Now, remember what I say.
When I say a thing, I do it.”</p>

<p>“You are altogether wrong. There is nothing of the sort;”
Downy answered in a stern voice that cowed her; “to the last
day of your life, you will repent it, if you dare to go meddling
there.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dare</i> is not a word to use to me,” she answered in a sullen
tone, and closed her lips. If she feared any one in the world
she feared her own son Donovan. The difference between her
will and his was as that between a torrent and the sea. Hers
was force, and his was power. Sometimes she was sorry for
her haste and fury; but in him there was no repentance.</p>

<p>He left her to herself, and said no more. In one thing they
were much alike. Neither of them had great faith in words,
whether used to them or by them. Having little faith in what
they heard, they expected little for what they said. It was no
affront to either of them, but an act of justice, to doubt every
word of their mouths, because their mouths were wells of leasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will have to clear out, poor old chap;” said Downy
that night to his father, whom he now regarded with rough
affection, as well as fitful pity. “All settled now, about you
know what. In three weeks or so, I shall have to slope. Who
would bring you your grub, but your dutiful son? What is it
about the ravens? And worse than that—she has smoked you
already. In spite of all pledges, you have been out at night.”</p>

<p>“Who could stay mewed up, night and day? Let her
smoke what she likes; I have got a pipeful for her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and for me, and yourself too. Bedlam, or hospital,
or workhouse for us all, if she finds you here, before the job is
done. After that, have it out, when you like. No dutiful son
interferes between his parents. If this is broken off, there will
be no shilling left, for you to have sixpence out of.”</p>

<p>It may fairly be hoped that he had some other plan, though
as yet he durst not mention it, for saving them both from the
awful meeting of which he spoke so lightly.</p>

<p>“How am I to know that it is settled even now? You have
put me off so many times. I might as well be on the <i>Simon
Pure</i> again.”</p>

<p>“I will show it you to-morrow in the paper, announced
for an early day—and it needs be an early one.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to doubt you. Not at all a truthful family. Three
weeks more, my son; and that’s every hour. Let her come
spying, if she likes. She never could keep her nose out of
anything, or perhaps I shouldn’t be quite as I am. I am sorry
for my lady; I only hope the pleasure will be mutual.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIII.<br />

<small>THERE SAT KITTY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">While</span> these things thus were growing near me, as I learned
soon afterwards, in our place there was no sign yet of anything
encouraging. My Uncle Corny, who had always vowed that
he never would bet a farthing, was now in a highly grumbling
state, because he had not backed <i>Nutmeg-grater</i>.</p>

<p>“A horse bred and born in our own fields—a colt I have
seen through the hedge fifty times, without caring to count his
legs almost, and he goes and wins five thousand pounds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
how much do I get? Not a penny. I think it was very unkind
of Sam; unnatural, and not neighbourly, to let Ludred get
all the good of that, and not a threepenny bit come to Sunbury!”</p>

<p>“Now, Uncle Corny, you talk of justice, and every one
calls you a superior man;” I said, with the desire to mollify
him, but the method misdirected; “how many times have I
heard Sam Henderson tell you to put a bit of money on that
horse? But you said—‘None of your gambling for me!’ And
now, because the horse has won, you think you have been ill-treated!”</p>

<p>“Kit, you stick to your own affairs. What do you know
about things like this? I want none of their dirty money. I
pay my way, by honest work. They are a set of rogues, all
together. You never see anything clearly now. Your wits are
always gone wool-gathering. Why, your own Aunt Parslow
won a box of gloves. And you are satisfied with my getting
nothing.”</p>

<p>It was true that my wits were wool-gathering now, but they
travelled a long way for nothing. Ever since Sam, and Major
Monkhouse, brought me the story of that strange vision, it
seemed to be dwelling in my brain, and driving every solid
sense out of it. All day long, and all night too, the same thing
was before me—a ship with white sails piled on one another, like
a tower of marble arches, the blue water breaking into silver at
her steps, and upon the forefront a figure standing, with arms
extended and bright eyes yearning, and red lips opened to say—“here
I am!”</p>

<p>I went to the post, three times a day, for we now had three
deliveries, and who could wait for old Bob’s slow round? And
often in the middle of a mutton-chop, which Tabby would grind
into my listless mouth, at a shadow on the window, or the
creaking of a door, I was up, and had my hat on, and was
listening in the lane.</p>

<p>Any one would laugh at the foolish things I did. I kept
the kettle boiling, day and night, until there was a hole in it,
and I had to buy another; I dusted all the chairs three times
a day; I kept a bunch of roses on the window-sill, and cut a
fresh tea-rose, every morn and evening, to go into Kitty’s
bosom, when she should appear. I ordered a cold chicken
every day from Mr. Rasp, and garnished it with parsley, and
handed it over with a sigh to Mrs. Tompkins, when nobody
came to taste it; and I made Polly Tompkins sleep with a
string round her arm, and the end hanging out of the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
Every man on the place swore that I was cracked, except
Selsey Bill, who stuck a spade up at my door.</p>

<p>“Afore the rust cometh down the blade of that there tool,
you’ll be a happy man, Master Kit,” he said; and as he spoke,
his little squinny eyes were bright with something that removes
the rust of human nature’s metal.</p>

<p>At last I was truly getting genuinely cracked. Another
week of burning hope and weltering dejection, of tossing to the
sky and tumbling to the depths of darkness, must have left my
dull brain empty of the little gift God put in it.</p>

<p>When a whole month had expired from the day when hope
awoke, reason fell upon me like a flail, and hope was chaff. I
made my usual preparations, with a bitter grin at them, and
set the roses in the window, with contempt of their loveliness.</p>

<p>“The last time of all this tomfoolery,” I said; “to-morrow
I shall work hard again. Everything is lies, and tricks, and
rot. Kitty has taken up with some fellow, and they are
laughing at me in some gambling-den. I have a great mind to
smash it up altogether. I shall sleep where that <i>Regulus</i> slept
to-night. Much good I did by stealing him. Hard work is
the only thing worth doing.”</p>

<p>It was the first time that I had ever dared to think such a
shameful thing of my pure wife; and I hope that I did not
think it now, but said it by the devil’s prompting. If any one
had said it in my hearing, he would have said little else for
another month. And I could have knocked my own self on the
head, with great pleasure, when I came to think of it.</p>

<p>We laugh very nicely—when they cannot hear us—at
women, for not knowing their own minds; but no woman ever
born, since they began to bear us, could have gainsayed herself,
as a man did, that day. I wandered about and lay under trees,
for now it was the 15th of June, and the weather warm and
sunny; then I climbed up trees and watched the river, and the
roads, and even the meadow-path, where the cows were, and
the mushrooms grew. Then I went and had a talk with Widow
Cutthumb, and when she began to run down the race of women,
I went so much further, that she grew quite sharp, and extolled
them, and put all the blame upon us. It was waste of time to
reason with her; so I let her have her own way, as they always
do.</p>

<p>Then I went to the butcher’s, and saw a fine sweet-bread,
the very thing for any one just come from a long journey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
perhaps a little giddy from the rolling of a ship. With a sigh
of despair I pulled out half a crown, and made him lend me a
basket and a clean white napkin. Then I could not run home
with it quick enough, for it seemed as if some one would be
dying without it; but as soon as I got to our door, I set it
down, and could not bring myself even to enter the house.
Away I went, and got into the loneliest place I could find; and
being rather light of head from grief and want of food, fell over
an old apple-trunk, and fell asleep beside it.</p>

<p>When I awoke, the sun was set; and the men (who were
now working overtime, to be ready for the strawberries) were
all gone home with their frails upon their backs, and their little
ones coming down the road to meet them. Dizzily I pushed
my way into a grassy alley, and sauntered homeward, wishing
only to go home for ever.</p>

<p>The front-door was open, which did not surprise me, for I
often left it so, and the basket containing the sweet-bread was
gone, and the roses were moved from the window. The sound
of my boots did not ring as it used, and the air seemed less
empty, and softer. In a stupefied hurry, I opened the door of
the parlour—and there sat Kitty!</p>

<p>Kitty looking at me, with a strange and timid look. As if
she were not certain that I would be glad to see her. As if she
doubted whether I could love her any more; as if her soul in
earth and heaven hung on the next moment.</p>

<p>I could not go to her, and I could not say a word; and to
tell the truth, I don’t know what I did. But I must have
spread my arms, by some gift of nature; for before I could
think of it, there she was; weeping—as I never could have
thought it possible for any one, even in this world of tears, to
weep.</p>

<p>Then she put up her hand, with the fingers thrown back,
and stroked my cheeks gently, and said—“How thin! How
thin!” Then she threw both arms around my neck, and
drew my face down to her lips, and covered every inch of it
with sobbing kisses. I pressed her sweet bosom to mine, and
our hearts seemed to beat into one another.</p>

<p>“Oh, Kit, my own, own dear old Kit! Can you ever forgive
me? Ever?”</p>

<p>She said this I dare say fifty times, scarcely allowing me
to speak, for she said it was not good for me; withdrawing and
feigning to be ashamed of her passionate love every now and
then; and then rushing into my embrace again. Then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
stood up, and threw back her beautiful hair, and said with the
glance which she knew I adored—</p>

<p>“Well, how do you think I am looking, love? Don’t you
think it is high time to tell me?”</p>

<p>She was wearing some foreign dress, beautifully cut, which
set off her figure; and she knew it very well.</p>

<p>“I never saw you looking half so lovely,” I replied; “though
I thought it impossible to improve you.”</p>

<p>“Sun-burnt, and freckled, and mosquito-bitten. But never
mind, dear, if you love your own wife. We’ll soon make all
that right again. Oh, I have been too wild! Feel how my
heart is jumping.”</p>

<p>She was threatened with hysterics; but I soothed her
gently, and she rested on my breast with her eyes half closed.
As I looked at her, I felt that in this rapture I could die.</p>

<p>“Darling, I can hardly believe it yet;” she whispered,
playing with my fingers to make sure; “see, this is my
wedding-ring, I never took it off. What fine gold it is, not to
tarnish with my tears. The drops that have fallen on it—oh,
I wonder there is any blue left in my eyes at all! Do you
think they are as blue, dear, as when you used to love them?”</p>

<p>“They are bluer, heart of hearts. They are larger and
deeper. The tears of true love have made them still more
lovely.”</p>

<p>“But yours are so worn, and sad, and harassed! That can’t
be from loving me more than I love you; because that is
simply impossible. But you never have been—tell me, tell me
all the truth. Was there any truth whatever in that horrible
tale? Remember I shall love you just the same. If you tore
me to pieces I should love you.”</p>

<p>“What horrible tale? I have never heard of any horrible
tale, except your going away.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know the reason! Oh Kit, oh Kit, have
you taken me back like this, without even knowing why I
went?”</p>

<p>“Darling I have not the least idea why you went. I was
too glad to get you back, to think of anything else.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are a true love! You are a husband such as
no woman on the earth deserves. I don’t think even I could
have taken you back so, if you had run away from me, and I
knew nothing of the cause.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you would, Kitty; I am sure you would. I
believe in you, just as you would in me, and talking has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
nothing to do with it. But how did you expect me to know
all about it?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, by the letter I sent you from Ascension.
The moment we got your letter—the moment I could stop
crying, crying, crying—I wrote you such a letter, darling. Oh,
I thought it would have killed me with wonder, and with joy.
It was almost as sweet as this—not quite, not quite; nothing
else can ever be quite so sweet as this.”</p>

<p>“Then were you with your father? Were you with him all
the time.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I was, dearest. Do you think I would have
gone with any one else, away from you—away from my own
husband?”</p>

<p>“But I thought it quite impossible for you to be with him.
He was far in the Atlantic, dear, before you ran away.”</p>

<p>“Before I ran away! Oh Kit, oh Kit! And you thought
I had run away with somebody else! Oh, what has my
misery been, compared with yours? No wonder you are thin,
dear; no wonder you are gaunt. Why, I can’t think how you
can have managed to keep alive. I am sure I should have been
dead, buried, and forgotten. Thirteen months, a year and a
month, to be thinking your own new-married wife had run
away, like a bad woman! Oh dear! Don’t stop me; I must
cry again, or I may do something worse. And you have not
even got my letter yet.”</p>

<p>“No. But I dare say it will come by-and-by. I expected
no letter from you, of course, because I had no idea where you
were; but every day I hoped for one from your father. But
they told me the mails from Ascension are uncertain, because
they take their chance of passing ships. Sometimes they don’t
come for months together.</p>

<p>“Now will you read this?” she cried, jumping up with
her old impetuosity; “I am very glad I kept it, though it
makes me creep every time I touch it. That explains everything.
Who wrote that?”</p>

<p>“It is like my writing; but I never wrote a word of it,
and never saw, or dreamed of it before.”</p>

<p>“Whoever wrote that letter, Kit,” my wife said very
solemnly, “ought to have his portion for ever and ever in the
bottomless pit, where the fire is not quenched. I could never
have believed that any human being could possibly have
conceived such wickedness. But don’t read it now; it would
take too long, and spoil our perfect happiness, darling. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
must not be so selfish. No more kisses, until we have done
our duty. Just put me into trim again, and let me do my hair
up, and we must both run down to Uncle Corny’s. Nobody
has seen me yet, but you. What do you think I did? I was
quite resolved that no one should see me, but my own husband.
So I left my things at Feltham, and ran all the way—flew all
the way, I ought to say, and came through Love Lane all
alone. Oh, we will never part again, not even for a day, Kit,
or half a day. You must never let me out of your sight any
more.”</p>

<p>“And not out of my arms, when I can help it,” I said,
as with my dear wife still enclasped, and her hair waving over
my bounding heart, I took her through the quiet alleys of the
summer night, just to show her for a minute—for I could not
spare her more—to the loyal and good Uncle Corny.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIV.<br />

<small>A MENSÂ ET TORO.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is out of my power to say, because I have never studied
human nature—having more than I can properly get through
with trees and animals—but according to the little I have seen,
the spirit of revenge is stronger in women, than it usually is in
us. Whatever wrong a man may have done me, if he only
says that he is sorry for it, or if without that I have got the
better of him, I am quite content that he should go, and settle
the question as between him and the Lord. I wish him no
ill, but what he may do himself; and even if I hear of his
getting his deserts, I feel no elation, but endeavour to be
sorry.</p>

<p>But my Uncle Corny, who understands the fair sex—at
least according to his own account—declares that they not only
cannot forgive a deadly wrong done to them, but continue to
think that the world is a bad place and sadly neglected by
Providence, until they see the people, who have made them
unhappy, paying out for it, as they ought to do.</p>

<p>My Kitty was the very best of all her sex—which is saying
a great deal more than some men may imagine, and means
much more than if it were said of them—but still I could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
that she was not contented even with our new honeymoon
(which was ten times sweeter than the first one, though that
had been most delicious), from a lofty desire for perfect justice;
which a man is quite satisfied to do without, knowing (as he
does) that otherwise he never could have satisfaction at all.</p>

<p>And yet I could see that she trembled, whenever she had
hinted at that little drawback, for fear of the danger that it
might involve to me; for she never seemed to think that I
could take care of myself, as well as she took care of me.</p>

<p>It is not for me to say, how these things are, or rather how
they ought to be; and I am free to acknowledge that if Downy
Bulwrag had come down meddling with my wife again, I
should have killed him; and risked the chance of being hanged
for a fellow unworthy of it. And when I read aloud that
wicked letter, in the presence of Kitty and my uncle, the next
day, there were times when I longed to have him by the throat,
and prevent more lies coming out of it. For the Devil himself
must have stood at his elbow, and gone into his brain as well,
while he was about it. And he had made the ground ready
for his lies to grow, by a black mysterious note beforehand,
signed—“A well-wisher in Sunbury.” This we had not in
our possession yet; but Kitty knew the effect of it upon her
father’s mind.</p>

<p>As I read the vile forgery, bearing my name, Uncle Corny
fell back in his chair, and shut his lips. Then he closed his
fist also, and from time to time he kept stamping with his
boots, as if his feet were tingling. But Kitty put her tender
hand into mine, and her breath was short, and her bosom heaved,
and her eyes flashed like the summer-lightning, or sometimes
filled with heavy drops.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear and respected Father-in-law</span>,—“I have a sad
confession to make to you, which I ought to have made long
ago, but I knew that I must have lost your daughter by it. I
will not pretend to excuse my conduct, for I know that I have
behaved shamefully. But I could not foresee the frightful
danger to which she is now exposed daily. My heart is almost
broken, for I love her wildly, savagely, and in plain truth
madly.</p>

<p>“Last Autumn I committed a very base act, and I am
justly punished for it. To keep your sweet Kitty here a little
longer, and give me more chances of seeing her, I was mean
enough to steal Miss Coldpepper’s favourite dog, a mongrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
called <i>Regulus</i>. I hid him in my uncle’s garden, while the
country was being searched for him; and thus, as perhaps you
remember, I obtained the honour of your acquaintance. But I
was punished for that sneakish trick. The cur bit me thrice
in the legs and thigh, and I am doomed to a horrible death I
fear; for the dog has gone mad, and the disease was in him
then.</p>

<p>“I have been, without any one’s knowledge, to the first
authority in London on such matters, and he says that I ought
to be watched, and must hold aloof from all family ties for a
while. He asked if I was married, and then he told me the
most horrible story I ever heard; and he conjured me, unless I
wished to kill my wife, to separate from her for at least two
years. When I would not promise that, he was anxious to
write to her relatives himself; but I gave him a false address,
and nothing came of that.</p>

<p>“I hoped that he might be mistaken, but now I feel that
he was only too correct. Your Kitty is not safe with me
another day. I have the most awful sensations sometimes.
The malady has got hold of me too surely, though nobody yet
suspects it. I have felt a wild desire to tear her to pieces;
and the only atonement I can make for my offence is to beg
you to take her immediately. You are likely to be away for
about two years; and when you return, if I am still alive, which
is most unlikely, I may safely reclaim her.</p>

<p>“I implore you not to let her know the cause of this sad
parting. It would keep her in awful suspense and misery, and
perhaps be as fatal to her, as I myself should be. She is so
good and dutiful, and trusts me so entirely, that if you say it is
my wish, for reasons you approve of—however she may grieve
about it, she will not rebel. Come for her, or send for her,
without my knowledge, without the knowledge of any one near
our place; for if the story got abroad, I should go mad at once.
My only hope lies in perfect quiet; therefore she must not write
to me, and I must not hear a word, even from yourself, about
her. She must not stop to pack up clothes, or anything whatever;
for if I came in, I should destroy her, if I saw it. But order
particularly that she shall take every farthing in the house she
knows of, to equip her for her long voyage in a seaport town.
The money is her own; and she must take it.</p>

<p>“I send this by hand, as I know not where you are; but
the bearer knows how to find you. There is no answer, except
to do what I implore most pitifully, if you wish to save your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
only child from a fearful death, at the hands of the one who
loves her <i>so madly</i>. I pray God that you may be yet in time.
I feel a little calmer after writing this. This morning I was in
agony at the sight of water. May the Lord have you, and my
darling in his keeping. Oh, how base I have been, but I have
done no murder yet!</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">“Your heart-broken son-in-law,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">C. Orchardson</span>.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>When I had finished, my uncle spoke; for Kitty could
only press my hand, and sometimes look at me, and sometimes
turn her eyes away and blush.</p>

<p>“These are the things,” my uncle said, “that make one
ashamed of being called a man. No snake could do such a
thing, and no dog would, however mankind might train him.
And the bit of piety towards the end! The father was a
blackguard, the mother a Fury, the son is the Devil with all
his angels. Oh Kit, Kit, I am old, and have met with a great
deal of wickedness, but none like this.”</p>

<p>“But you know, Uncle Corny, you must not be disturbed,”
said Kitty going up to him, and kissing his forehead, in her
sweet and graceful way, “just because there happen to be bad
people in the world. It has always been so, and I fear it
always must. And you must not imagine that Kit meant any
harm, by—by just borrowing Auntie Coldpepper’s dog. He
did it—oh, so cleverly—just for the sake of seeing me; and
he quite changed the character of that dog. But how can that
bad man have found it out?”</p>

<p>“Through Harker,” I exclaimed, “through that wretch of
a Harker, who was always spying on these premises. Sam
Henderson knew it, most likely through him; but Sam would
never have spoken of it.”</p>

<p>“It is true, then,” said my uncle. “Well, I thought it was
a lie. I am surprised to find that I have a dogstealer for my
nephew.”</p>

<p>“It was Tabby made him do it. And I am very glad she
did. But the first thing Dr. Cutler said to me, when my heart
was nearly broken with his message, was—‘Did your husband
steal that dog?’ And of course I said ‘Yes;’ for Kit had
told me all about it, when we were at Baycliff; and no doubt
that convinced the good doctor that all the rest of that sad
wicked letter was true. You know, Uncle Corny, that it was
impossible for my father to leave the ship, and he sent his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
friend Dr. Cutler to fetch me. Oh, how I did cry all the way!
I thought there never would be any more happiness for me.
And of course they never told me why I was to go. I thought
that Kit must be tired of me; and yet I could not quite
believe that, you know. Oh, Kit, I shall never be tired of
you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, my darling,” said my uncle kindly. “We have
had enough tears to drown that devilish letter. Now sit on
Kit’s lap, to make sure of him, and tell me your own adventures,
for I have only guessed them yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had no adventures, and I never noticed anything,
only to ask how far we were from England, and to count the
days till we should have finished all the work. I made a little
calendar, as the girls do at school, the girls I mean who have
real mothers, and I blotted out every day when it was over,
and thought—‘one less now before I see Kit again.’ Of
course I asked my father what had made him send for me, and
he said it was my husband’s most earnest entreaty, and if I
loved him I must ask no more, but keep up my spirits and
obey his orders. Father never showed me this letter, or I
think—though I can’t be quite sure—that I should have
doubted about it. The writing is exactly like Kit’s in some
places, but in others it is different, and the style is not like
Kit’s. That wicked man stole several letters of Kit’s; I
suspected it then, and now I know it.</p>

<p>“My father had not the smallest doubt, of course, but he
was puzzled when I spoke about that telegram, you know what
I mean—the one from Captain Jenkins at Falmouth, to say
the ship was on her voyage, and to send good-bye to us. He
had sent no such message, and had spoken no such ship, and
said that it must be some extraordinary mistake. But you see
now it was another piece of falsehood, to make it look impossible
that I could be with my father.</p>

<p>“It was father himself who went to Baycliff to inquire,
knowing that we had been there, and being near it. But he
could not come here, and so he sent Dr. Cutler, who knows all
this neighbourhood well, and managed it all to perfection with
the help of some one, who was sent by agreement to meet him.
Oh dear, when I think of that dreadful time; and I was not
allowed to leave a line for my husband, except what I wrote,
on the sly, in the Prayer-book. Well, that did him some good,
at any rate; didn’t it, my own darling?</p>

<p>“I am quite ashamed to talk of my own sorrow, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
think of what Kit has been through for me. But I am sure
I ate nothing for at least a month, and Dr. Cutler, who was
in charge of the health of the ship’s company, became quite
uneasy about me. As for their experiments, deep-sea dredging,
and soundings, and temperatures, and all that, I did not even
care to look at them, and I am not a bit more scientific than
when I went out, though perhaps I shall talk as if I was,
by-and-by. The only thing I felt any interest in was the
rescue of a poor afflicted man—I think they called him a
Spaniard, though he seemed to me more like an Englishman—who
was kept as a prisoner among some savages in a desert
place in South America. He was terribly afflicted with some
horrible disease; and the sailors would not go near him, until
they were ashamed when they saw me do it. We were all
very kind to him, but he left us, and got on board another
ship bound for home.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I used to tremble, Kit, whenever we saw a ship
in the distance, hoping for news of you, my dear, and of Uncle
Corny, and everybody. But we met very few ships, being
generally employed in out-of-the-way places, and only landing
anywhere two or three times, for water, or fruit, or vegetables.</p>

<p>“But when we got to Ascension Island, which is an English
place, you know, what a joyful surprise there was for me! I
shall always bless that little rocky spot, for it gave me back my
life again. When father received my husband’s letter, for the
first time in his life, he was in a real fury. Something or other
had occurred before, besides that affair of the telegram, which
made him a little doubtful about this wicked, wicked letter.
And now he saw at once that he had been imposed upon most
horribly. We were all afraid that he would have had a fit, but
Dr. Cutler saved him.</p>

<p>“‘My poor injured child!’ he kept on exclaiming;
‘wretched for at least a year, and injured for life, by this
monstrous villainy!’ He would have thrown up his command
at once, if he could have done it honourably, and brought me
home by the very next ship. But if he had done so, the cruise
must have ended; for Lieutenant Morris, who was next to him,
was invalided at Fort George. I was quite ready to come home
alone, by any ship, English or foreign; but as it happened, Dr.
Cutler received by the same mail an urgent request from his
wife for his return; and so the very gentleman I ran away
with brought me back to my husband. It was a long time
before we could get a ship, and then it was only a sailing vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
and oh how slowly she seemed to go! Then about a month
ago, we had a very heavy storm, which drove us I don’t know
how far out of our course, and I thought that I never should
see Kit again. But now it seems all like a horrible dream.
Father will be home, in November, I hope. I intend to work
hard to help Uncle Corny; and Kit will soon be well again,
with me to mind him.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXV.<br />

<small>HER OWN WAY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">You</span> must not let it drop, Kit; you can’t let it drop,” said
Aunt Parslow, as she sat in our parlour, the next day, having
ordered Parker’s fly, as soon as she received my letter; “for
the sake of your sweet wife, you are absolutely bound to expose
this horrid miscreant. I doubt if there ever was such a
case before, though nothing ever surprises me. It was very
nasty of you to steal that dog—why, you might have come and
stolen <i>Jupiter</i>, on the very same principle of a pretty girl—and
you have been punished, even more than you deserved.
You deserved a month in the stocks perhaps, with all the dogs
in the village sniffing at you; but you did not deserve to lose
your own wife, just when you had time to get fond of her. I
am not for revenge; I am too old to fancy that we can do much
to right ourselves, even if the feeling was Christian; but I
belong to an honourable family, in which the fair fame of a
lady was never neglected.”</p>

<p>“I declare I never thought once of that; it never occurred
to me in that light,” I answered with perfect truth; for my
Kitty’s fair fame seemed to me so entirely above all question,
that it could not need any assertion; “but since it is capable
of being looked at so, there is no doubt what my duty is.”</p>

<p>“No husband of proper spirit could doubt for a moment
what his duty is.” Miss Parslow spoke very severely; but
my wife looked at her reproachfully, and ran up to me.</p>

<p>“No, Kit, no. You shall not go near him. There is
nothing too bad for him to do. I have lost you quite long
enough already. What do I care what anybody says? Miss
Parslow, you have been wonderfully kind, and it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
to thank you. Don’t spoil it all, by putting this into his
head.”</p>

<p>“My dear, we shall send the two policemen with him,” my
aunt replied rather sarcastically; “we know how precious he
is, and we won’t have him hurt. Or perhaps your Uncle
Cornelius might go. He has no wife, to make a to-do about
him. Look, here he comes with somebody, to tell us something!
He walks like a man of thirty-five, and how polite he
always is!”</p>

<p>Uncle Corny had brought Mrs. Wilcox from his house, and
that good lady was in great excitement. She fell upon Kitty,
and kissed and hugged her, until I thought really there had
been enough of that; and then she turned round, and addressed
us at large, casting forth her words with vehemence, and throwing
out her hands, as if to catch them.</p>

<p>“Ladies, and gents, oh ladies and gents, such a thing have
just come to my knowledge through Ted, which is the most
intellectuous boy, though my own child, and was never such
myself. I set off straightway, when I heard it, and beg to
excoose of my present disapparel, to catch the three ten ’bus,
or else wait another hour. And if there is a good horse on the
place, which by the look of it there must be many, I do beg of
Master Kit to put him in at once, if not too late to prevent bloody
murder. Them police is so slow, so slow; though I never join
in a single word against them, for all morshal men is fallible.”</p>

<p>“I can’t make out what it is,” said Uncle Corny, when we
all looked at him, for an explanation; “this good lady must be
allowed her own time; I am afraid that I have hurried
her.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Mr. Orchardson, not at all. Nothing could be
more gentlemanly, and I will say the same of all Sunbury. But
the wedding was to be to-morrow, gents, regardless of expense,
at eleven o’clock, at the church of Saint Nicholas, the Virgin.
It was not for me to forbid the banns, though knowing of holy
impediments. Very handsome it was to be with six bridesmaids,
Miss Frizzy and Miss Jerry for two of them. Cook,
who is a very self-respected young woman, though Ted says she
have turned forty-two, and no concern of his if she is even
two and forty, she dropped in promiscuous and told me all about
it, and all was as merry as a marriage-bell. But just as I was
having my bit of dinner, in she comes with her cap-ribbons
flying off, and her apron-strings burst, being rather stout with
running.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘For God’s sake, come up, Mrs. Wilcox,’ she says ‘or
there’ll be murder done, murder done, and nobody to see it.’</p>

<p>“I was there in two minutes, as you may suppose; and
there was madam, tearing up and down the front walk, with
her black silk cloak on that makes her look so tall, and her face—oh,
you should have seen the colour of it, and the flashing of
her eyes, and the waving of her arms. ‘I insist upon knowing.
I insist upon going in. Am I going to be locked out of my own
house? To-morrow, indeed! Don’t talk to me of to-morrow.
How dare you prevent me from entering my own door? I’ll
find out your disgraceful tricks, and expose you. You are not
fit to marry a respectable girl. I’ll send for a policeman, and
have the door forced.’</p>

<p>“‘You won’t do anything of the kind,’ her son Mr. Downy
made answer quietly, although I could see that he was awful
pale, and he sat on a kitchen chair in front of the door, with
his broad shoulders set against it. ‘I tell you it is for your
sake that I will not allow it. You may walk about all night,
but you won’t walk in here.’</p>

<p>“Ladies, and gents, she kept pacing up and down, like a
Beelzebub more than a mortal woman, raving and ranting to
such a degree, that a crowd of people came and looked over the
gate, and they began to cry, ‘Bravo, Rous!’ ‘Go it, old lady!’
‘Hit him hard, he ain’t got no friends’—and all that stuff; you
know how free and easy a London crowd is. Then she marched
up to the gate, and looked at them, and they fell away ashamed,
and she walked into the house. But have her way she will,
before the sun goes down. She has sworn it, and she never
breaks her oath.”</p>

<p>“It is no concern of ours,” said my uncle very sensibly;
“what have we to do with such family quarrels? What made
you come to us, Mrs. Wilcox?”</p>

<p>“Two things, sir; in the first place, you know more of the
law than any gentleman I know. You remember how you told
me that last winter, and every word you said came true as
gospel. And what is more than that, poor Miss Jerry, and Miss
Frizzy backed her up in that same, she says to me—‘Oh, Mrs.
Wilcox, do try to get that nice young man from Sunbury, that
married poor Kitty Fairthorn. He has more power over mother
than any one on earth. She is afraid of him, that’s the truth,
though she’d box my ears if she heard me say so. ‘There might
be time enough,’ she says, ‘if you’d set off directly, and I’ll pay
all expenses.’ Well, I thought it must come from Heaven that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
I should be thinking of the uncle, and she of the nephew; and
so come, both gents, I beg of you; there’ll be murder between
them, if you don’t; for the police can’t interfere, you know.”</p>

<p>“Kit, let us go,” said my Uncle Corny, as some new idea
struck him; “we cannot interfere of course, but we can see
the end of it.”</p>

<p>Kitty was very much against my going, and I would not
have left her, unless Miss Parslow had promised to stay with
her, until our return, although it would compel her to send
back the fly, and beg a bed for the night from her old friend
Sally.</p>

<p>My uncle took a big stick, and so did I; and in a quarter
of an hour we started in the tax-cart, with Mrs. Wilcox on the
cushion. I was the driver, and my uncle sat behind, for there
was no room for three of us, all rather broad, in front. And
certainly I was the calmest of the three, for the good lady was
in a dreadful fright and fret; and my uncle sat heavily, with
his chin upon his stick, taking no notice of the roads or streets,
but dwelling on the distance of bygone sorrow. The wrong he
had suffered was greater than mine in one way, and less in
another; greater, because it was incurable; lighter, because
less cold-blooded and crafty, and not inflicted on him through
his own wife. But I, with my Kitty recovered, and still in
the new delight of that recovery, had triumphed already in the
more important part, and was occupied rather with contempt
than hatred. And it seemed to me too an extraordinary thing,
and the last I should ever have predicted, that I should be
entreated by the daughters of that most naughty and headstrong
woman, to come and exert for her own good my imaginary
power over her.</p>

<p>We put up our cart at the <i>Bricklayer’s Arms</i>, where Ted
had been pot-boy—or potman he called himself—and then we
all hurried towards Bulwrag Park. The midsummer sun had
just gone down; and as the red light glanced along the broad
stately roads, I thought of the words of that violent lady—“before
the sun goes down, I will have my way.”</p>

<p>We passed between some posts into the open space, coveted
vainly by builders, where the old Scotch firs (which had been
my Kitty’s landmark) still waved their black pillows against
the western sky. Then a number of people came rushing by
us, driven by that electric impulse, which flashes through the
human heart that human life is passing. With the contagion
of haste we began to run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can’t come in. Nobody allowed past this rope.”</p>

<p>A posse of policemen had drawn a cord across the road,
outside the old gate, because that was a very poor obstacle; and
now I dare say there were a hundred people pushing; and in
five minutes there would be a thousand.</p>

<p>I said, “I am Professor Fairthorn’s son-in-law, and the two
young ladies have sent for me. And Mrs. Wilcox is an
old servant of the family, who was sent in haste to fetch me.”</p>

<p>They dropped the rope at this, and let us in; being reasonable,
as the police are generally, unless you rub their coats up
the wrong way of the cloth.</p>

<p>But what a sight we had, when once we turned the corner!
Having never been brought up in battle-fields, but only where
apples and pears grow, I found myself all abroad, and felt my
legs desirous to go away from one another. But my uncle laid
hold of me, and said—“This is what it comes to. The man,
who has been a man, may look on at the Devil.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilcox turned back; for her nerves were rheumatic;
but they would not let her pass the rope again. I was looking
round, and saw it, with a desire to do the same; but my uncle
had me by the collar, and I knew that he was right, though I
would rather not have known it.</p>

<p>“Stop, and see the works of God,” he said. And I
answered—“No, I would rather not, if this is a sample of
them.”</p>

<p>For before the front door there were things going on,
which made it impossible to let that house after it came into
our possession, even to a most enlightened widow from
America—or at any rate she took it, and then threw it up
again. There were as good as three corpses laid out upon the
lawn, with a doctor attending upon each and two policemen;
and one of them also had a magistrate.</p>

<p>Uncle Corny drew me forward, as I shrank behind the
bay-tree, where Kitty had been with me, when the great snow
began. “You are only fit for a turtle-dove. Where is your
gall?” he whispered.</p>

<p>It may have been a very low default on my part. But
when my worst enemy lies on the ground, I would rather lift
him up, than walk over him. My uncle was of sterner stuff,
or less live softness—for his injury had been more deadly.
He tried to drag me forward; but I would not budge, though
I might make a beggar of myself by that refusal.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid to look at death, you white-livered young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
fool?” he whispered, and his face was black with the pitch of
fury.</p>

<p>“I have been through ten times worse than death,” I answered,
looking at him steadfastly; “and the lesson I have
learned is mercy.”</p>

<p>Before he could answer, with the bitterness of justice, which
to him was greater, two young women ran across the grass,
and they both caught hold of me and shrieked. I could not
make out what they said, because it was mixed up with sobs,
and they cried both together; but I left myself to them, and
they drew me on to the place where their mother lay stretched
upon the walk, with a medical man bending over her.</p>

<p>“Dr. Wiggins?” he asked; and I answered, “No, not a
doctor at all.” And he said, “Clear out; I shall take the four
ounces on my own responsibility.”</p>

<p>“A friend of the family. A true friend of the family,”
Miss Jerry exclaimed, to my great surprise; but he answered—“Then
let him get out of the way; and the sooner you go
away too, the better.”</p>

<p>The sour-faced woman, a faithful retainer, was supporting
the poor lady’s head on a cushion; and I scarcely allowed
myself a glance at the proud face, now so deathly. But that
one glance told me for ever what all human pride must come
to.</p>

<p>“Oh, come and see Downy! He can’t be dead too. Oh,
come, and forgive him before he is dead.”</p>

<p>Which of the girls said this I know not. But I took up
my hat, which I had thrown on the grass, and followed them
to their brother.</p>

<p>There lay the man who had robbed me of my wife, the
cold-blooded, godless miscreant, robbed by his own hand for
ever of all hope of due repentance. Within a few yards of him
lay his poor father, dead as a stone, and cold as ice, slain by
the wickedness he had begotten, shot through the heart by his
heartless son.</p>

<p>Donovan Bulwrag looked at me. He was sensible still;
though before the waning light upon his ghastly face should
vanish, light and darkness would be one to him. He knew
me, and I am grieved to say, for his own poor sake, that he
hated me still. He had not heard of Kitty’s return, I suppose,
having been so absorbed in his own affairs, and he muttered
through the red foam that streaked his lying lips—for he had
fired the ball through the roof of his mouth—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>“How like—darling Kitty—run away—with officer?”</p>

<p>“She is with me. Her father found out your tricks, and
sent her home. She is well and very happy. She ran away
with no officer.”</p>

<p>“Let him alone, sir; don’t excite him,” said the surgeon
who was stooping over him. “I must have you removed if
you come near him.” Then with another turn of thought he
said,—“If there has been ill-will between you, make it up;
he cannot last half an hour. Will you take his hand if he
wishes it?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure; but I know that he does not wish it. Do
you wish me to take your hand, Mr. Bulwrag? If you do, look
at me, and nod your head.”</p>

<p>To my amazement, the dying man turned his eyes on me,
and nodded his head. His eyes were clouded with the approach
of death, and I saw very little expression in them. Then he
moved his left hand feebly towards me, while the other dropped,
as if through exhaustion, to the ground. My right hand lay
in his clammy palm, and bending forward, I watched his face
for some token of good will and penitence.</p>

<p>Suddenly a red glare as of lightning filled his eyes, his
features worked horribly, and his great teeth clashed as he
tried to jerk me towards him. Luckily for me I was poised
upon both feet. At the flash of his eyes I sprang aside, a
redder flash blinded me, and a roar rang in my ears, and upon
the bosom of the dying man lay the short thick curl, the love-lock
Kitty was so fond of playing with. The ball had passed
within an inch of my temple, and my forehead was black with
the pistol-smoke.</p>

<p>“Narrow shave,” said the doctor, “that will be his last
act. I hope he will have life enough to know that it has
failed. I had not the least idea he had got that revolver
under his coat-flap. What are the police about? It’s not my
place to see to a thing of that sort. And he might have shot
me while he was about it! There he goes! I thought so.
Serve him right.”</p>

<p>The great head fell back, and the square chin dropped, a
dull glaze spread upon the upturned eyes, a wan gray haze as
of icy vapour crept across the relaxing face, and Donovan
Bulwrag was gone to render an account of his doings in the flesh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilcox ran up with a sob, and fetched the heavy eyelids
downward. “Poor young man! He have run his course.
I hope he has gone to heaven,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>But my Uncle Corny looked at me, and at the fallen pistol.
“I wish him only his due,” he said; “and I hope he has gone
to the Devil.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHAPTER LXVI.<br />

<small>ONE GOOD WISH.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> must have been a fearful scene, about an hour before we
reached that spot. Two powerful wills were in collision—one
hard as steel, the other trenchant and resistless as red-hot iron.
For many days the conflict had been gathering force and fury,
as the rising wind collects its power, before the outbreak of the
storm.</p>

<p>The mother was resolved to pierce the mystery of her
crafty son. The son was equally resolute to keep his fatal
secret. And the father, turbulent and headstrong, wrapped in
his own vindictive mood, cared not when the outbreak came,
but looked forward to it grimly.</p>

<p>It had been impossible for Downy, as he had naturally
foreseen, to keep entirely to himself the presence of a stranger
in the house. Although the room was far away from the part
his mother occupied, and darkened for the Professor’s use, and
secluded by thick shrubbery, it soon became needful for the
jailor to secure a confederate. With some misgivings, he took
the sour-faced woman into his confidence, knowing her to be
close and faithful, as well as clever and resourceful. But
unluckily for himself he did not trust the woman wholly.
Skinner, as she was called in the household, did not know the
real import of the plan she aided. Falsehood was her master’s
nature, and he did no despite to it, by relapsing into truth.
He told her a chapter of lies; and she had no inkling that the
stowaway, whose face she was never allowed to see, was the
husband of her mistress.</p>

<p>Thus she was not on her guard so strictly as she would have
been, had she known the truth. To learn the existence of a
secret is to be halfway towards it; and the pride as well as
curiosity of the mistress was soon afoot. But the room was
securely locked, and vain was any prowling round it; till
indignation and sense of outrage grew no longer bearable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>After that public outbreak of passion, which had scared
the cook, and Mrs. Wilcox, the lady of the house retreated to
her room, and was taken or feigned to be taken ill. Her son
was sent for, in great haste, and found her prostrate, and
broken down, scarcely able to speak, and quite unlikely to
attack his stronghold again. His sisters implored him to take
a cab, and follow the course of the only doctor who could
relieve these perilous pains; and after seeing to his locks and
bolts, he departed on that mission.</p>

<p>No sooner had the front gate swung behind him, than up
jumped the feeble sufferer, wrote a few lines to the nearest
blacksmith, and sent the boy in buttons to take them, with
orders not to lose a moment. In a quarter of an hour the
blacksmith and his foreman were at the obnoxious door, with
sledge-hammer, crowbar, cold chisel, and wrench.</p>

<p>Some one within seemed inclined to help them, for they
heard a heavy bolt shot back; but the door was fastened on the
outside also with a heavy chain and padlock. The smith laid
hold of this chain with his pincers, and so kept the padlock
against the post, where a few swinging blows from the foreman
shattered it, like an egg-shell. In a minute they cast the door
back on its hinges, and a narrow dark passage was before
them.</p>

<p>“Let no one follow me,” said the lady of the house; “but
wait till I return to you.” She closed the heavy door behind
her, and passed through the gloom to an inner door. This was
neither locked nor bolted, and she turned the handle and
entered.</p>

<p>The room was lofty, but very dark. Not only the bulk of
the ilex-tree, but close blinds, fixed in the window-frame, obscured
the fading sunlight. The lady marched in with a
haughty air; she would soon let this poor vagrant know who
was the owner of this house and who the gutter-squatter. But
suddenly she stopped, and speech was flown from her tongue to
her eyes; she could only stare.</p>

<p>Against the high mantlepiece, whose black marble covered
with dust was as dull as slate, a tall and bulky man was leaning,
peacefully smoking a long cigar. The cigar was fixed
between two strips of muslin, concealing the chin, lips, and
nose, if any. A slouched hat, with a yellow feather in it,
covered the hairless crown; and only the knotted forehead, and
the fierce red eyes, showed that here was a human face alive.</p>

<p>But the massive cast of figure, and the attitude, and slouch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
and even some remembrance of the fierce red glance, told the
haughty woman who it was that stood before her. In a moment,
fury changed to fear, and triumph became trembling. Without a
word she turned to fly; but a great muffled hand was laid on
her.</p>

<p>“No hurry, faithful wife! You have insisted upon seeing
me. Come to the light, and you shall have that pleasure.”</p>

<p>The great figure swept her to the window with one arm,
while she vainly strove to cry, or even to fall upon her knees.
Then throwing back the blind, the leper drew her closer to him,
and tearing off his swathings held her so that she must gaze at
him.</p>

<p>“This is your work. Are you pleased with it? True love
is never changed by trifles. Embrace me, my gentle one. You
always were so loving. How you will rejoice to show a wife’s
affection, and to tend me daily; for I mean to leave you never
more. Monica, gentle, loving Monica, whisper your true love
where my ears used to be.”</p>

<p>With the mad strength of horror, she dashed from his arms,
and away through the passage, and would have escaped—for
the poor cripple could only limp in pursuit—if she had not
closed the outer door. By the time she had opened, he was
upon her, and they staggered together across the broad walk,
when their son from the gate rushed up to them.</p>

<p>“Oh, save me, save me from that beast!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Off, and get back to your den!” shouted Downy.</p>

<p>“A nice son, to part his own parents!” As the old man
spoke, he struck his son in the face with his maimed right
hand, while he clung to his wife with the other.</p>

<p>Then Donovan Bulwrag, in a fury of the moment, drew his
revolver, and shot his father through the heart.</p>

<p>The old man fell on his back a corpse, while the mother
was dashed on the grass, and lay senseless. Donovan looked
at them both, gave a laugh, put the muzzle in his mouth, and
shot himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have no intention to moralize—as a man always says when
he begins to do it—but there ended three misguided lives; for
although Mrs. Bulwrag recovered slowly some of her bodily
health and vigour, her mind was never restored to life again.
That hectoring will, and domineering spirit, lapsed into the
weakness of a weanling child; and if ever the memory of those
haughty days returned, it waned into a shudder, or an abject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
smile. When Captain—or as he now is called Sir Humphrey
Fairthorn came home from his celebrated enterprise, he made
due provision in a private asylum for the lady who could no
longer pick his pockets. The marriage settlements fell to the
ground, with the downfall of the marriage, and six acres of
“the most magnificently situated building land in London,”
returned to the heritage of Kitty’s mother.</p>

<p>When my uncle and myself came sadly home from that
shocking and distressing scene, the power of it lay upon us
still, so that we did not care to speak.</p>

<p>“Thank God,” said my wife, as she fell upon my breast,
after trying to sponge off the blaze from my temple, which
would take some days to heal; “thank God that he is dead at
last!”</p>

<p>Those are the only words of hers I have ever felt displeased
with. At the moment they seemed harsh to me; by reason of
the pity, which the eye engenders, but the tongue cannot advance.
If she had come from that piteous sight, her heart
would have been too soft for this.</p>

<p>“It is a good job for everybody else, and a bad one for him,”
said Uncle Corny; “he is gone where he addressed himself.
He labelled himself—‘To the Devil with care—to be delivered
immediately.’ And then he goes and acts as his own porter.
You need not look sentimental, Kit. What is England coming
to? Lord bless my heart the stuff they talk about ‘the sanctity
of human life!’ A good man’s life belongs to God, and a bad
one’s to the Devil. And they have got themselves to thank
for it.”</p>

<p>A very broad saying is seldom deep; but the general vote
was against me. And all being on the right side, of course,
they backed it up with buttresses.</p>

<p>“Think of that poor man,” said Kitty, who was always
first to see things; “from what you say of his sad condition,
and his size, and figure, I am quite sure it is the afflicted
prisoner we rescued from the savages. You may talk of things
not being guided by a Higher Power, and you may look black
if it is hinted that a man shouldn’t shoot his father, and then
try to kill my darling Kit; but what can you say, when it
comes to light, that but for his own wicked plot, the cruelest and
the wickedest that ever entered human heart—or brain, for he
never could have owned a heart—if it had not been for that, no
doubt, he would have married a lovely girl—though some may
call her too pale and thin—and probably have stolen all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
money, and no doubt broken her poor heart, as he did his
utmost to break mine? And then in the very stroke of death,
he tries to murder Kit again! Oh, how can I be sorry that we
are safe from him at last?”</p>

<p>“Kitty is right,” Miss Parslow said; “Kit would have
killed that man, if he caught him shooting Kitty. And that
would have been the very next thing he would have done, if
the Lord had spared him.”</p>

<p>To this I could make no reply; for verily I believe it
would have been.</p>

<p>“Take your wife home,” said Uncle Corny, who always
saw the right thing to do; “she is much excited. Avoid this
subject, until you can speak of it calmly. Thank God for all
His goodness to you; and let her nurse your wounded hair.”</p>

<p>This made Kitty laugh and pout; and without another
word I led her home.</p>

<p>I led my Kitty home, without any fear of losing her again,
until, by the will of One who loves us, we bid each other a
brief farewell. We live at Honeysuckle Cottage still, and
wish to go no further, adding to it, as little growers, like roses,
cluster round us. We might lead a gayer and noisier life, if
that were to our liking; but we have seen enough of the
world to know how nice it is, at a distance. Whatever the
greatest people do I can read to Kitty in the evening; and she
smiles or sighs in the proper places, without neglecting our
own affairs. The puff of the passing world comes to us, like
that of a train in the valley; or even as the whiff of a smoker
in the lane comes over our wall with a delicate waft, albeit his
tobacco is not first-rate.</p>

<p>Moreover we like to be, where pleasant friends drop in,
and say—“What a sweet calm is here!” And where Uncle
Corny still toddles up at supper-time every evening, and lays
his now quivering hand upon the curls of his sturdy Godson
Cornelius, and says, “You shall have all this place, my boy;
for your rogue of a father is too rich to want it, with all that
property in London. Let him grow houses, while you grow
trees. Keep the old place on, if you can; and sell your own
fruit, if you want to get the money.”</p>

<p>Inditing of the higher fruit, that suffers no decay, and is
meted in no earthly measure, the Rev. Peter Golightly enters,
followed by his blooming daughter. He blesses all the little
ones; and so does she, by kissing them with her pure sweet lips.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Miss Bessy, keep your lips in practice;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
exclaims Uncle Corny in his rough old style; and a healthy
blush mantles where the hectic colour was; for the gentle
young lady has won the heart of the vicar—not of Bray, but
a parish very near it.</p>

<p>But which of them all can be thought of twice, with Kitty
looking at me? My words must be plentiful indeed, if one
can be spared for any other. Yet for two good reasons I will
not attempt to praise her. Being a busy man I must forego
all hopeless efforts; and again what would success be? Simply
that, which according to the proverb, is “no recommendation.”</p>

<p>So all who are well disposed can wish me nothing more
complete than this, that I may live with her long enough to
discover some defect in her. And in return I will inflict no
moral but that of all true love—let every Kit be constant to
his better self—his Kitty.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
